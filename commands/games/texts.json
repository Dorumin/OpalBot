    "The streets were cleared by a Critical Mass bike ride and were flooded by activists dressed in second-hand suits with slogans painted on their backs. They danced in the doorsteps of office towers, formed a human chain around the Treasury and held peaceful sit-ins at several banks.",
    "But the two men were not lonely at all. At home they were content to eat and drink, and Singer would talk with his hands eagerly to his friend about all that was in his mind. So the years passed in this quiet way until Singer reached the age of thirty-two.",
    "Wilkinson County was a recipient of one of the new \"separate but equal\" schools built throughout the South as a result of the 1954 Supreme Court decision. It had been under construction on a fifty-two-acre plot in Woodville for almost a year, when I graduated in 1959.",
    "Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other, and I've seen a lot of strange stuff. But I've never seen anything to make me believe that there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls MY destiny.",

    "You could choke a dozen donkeys on that! And you're haggling over one hundred pound? What do you do when you're not buying stereos, Nick? Finance revolutions? You've got Liberia's deficit in your skyrocket!",
    "Let's sort the buyers from the spiers, the needy from the greedy, and those who trust me from the ones who don't, because if you can't see value here today, you're not up here shopping. You're up here shoplifting. Anyone like jewelry?",
    "So I'm two inches away from her. Her luscious lips part. Just as I'm about to kiss her, she looks at me and she says, \"What's your name?\" Gogol Ganguli. End of seduction 101.",
    "We turn away to face the cold, enduring chill, as the day begs the night for mercy love. The sun so bright it leaves no shadows, only scars, carved into stone on the face of earth. The moon is up and over One Tree Hill we see the sun go down in your eyes.",
    "And in the world a heart of darkness, a firezone, where poets speak their hearts then bleed for it. Jara sang, his song a weapon, in the hands of love. You know his blood still cries from the ground. It runs like a river to the sea. We run like a river runs to the sea.",
    "We turn away to face the cold, enduring chill, as the day begs the night for mercy love. The sun so bright it leaves no shadows, only scars, carved into stone on the face of earth. The moon is up and over One Tree Hill we see the sun go down in your eyes.",
    "I don't believe in painted roses or bleeding hearts while bullets rape the night of the merciful. I'll see you again when the stars fall from the sky and the moon has turned red over One Tree Hill.",

    "Comfortable, Mullet? It seems sadly ironic that it's that tie that's got you into this pickle. Now you just take all the time you want. You can play some music if you like.",
    "What about Tony? You know, Bullet Tooth Tony. He'll find you Moses in the burning bush, if you pay him to. He got shot six times, had the bullets molded into gold. He's the best chance you got of finding Franky.",
    "My name is Turkish. Funny name for an Englishman, I know. My parents to be were on the same plane when it crashed. That's how they met. They named me after the name of the plane. Not many people are named after a plane crash.",
    "Do you know why they call him Franky \"Four Fingers\" Doug? Because he makes stupid bets with dangerous people, and when he doesn't pay up, they give him the chop, Doug. And I'm not talking about his foreskin either.",
    "It turned out that the sweet-talking, tattoo-sporting pikey was a gypsy bare-knuckle boxing champion. Which makes him harder than a coffin nail. Right now, that's the last thing on Tommy's mind. If Gorgeous doesn't wake up in the next few minutes, Tommy knows he'll be buried with him.",
    "I don't want to go in there. He's a dangerous bastard. Taken too many disco biscuits in the heat of Russian disputations. He's got as many of these nuts as he has those nuts.",
    "One thing I've learned in the last seven years: in every game and con there's always an opponent, and there's always a victim. The trick is to know when you're the latter, so you can become the former.",
    "There is something about yourself that you don't know. Something that you will deny even exists, until it's too late to do anything about it. It's the only reason you get up in the morning. We share an addiction. We're approval junkies. We're all in it for the slap on the back and the gold watch.",
    "Oh bliss! Bliss and heaven! Oh, it was gorgeousness and gorgeousity made flesh. It was like a bird of rarest-spun heaven metal or like silvery wine flowing in a spaceship, gravity all nonsense now. As I slooshied, I knew such lovely pictures!",
    "You needn't take it any further, sir. You've proved to me that all this ultraviolence and killing is wrong, wrong, and terribly wrong. I've learned me lesson, sir. I've seen now what I've never seen before. I'm cured! Praise Bog! I'm cured!",
    "Excellent. He's enterprising, aggressive, outgoing, young, bold, vicious. He'll do. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.",
    "But suddenly, I viddied that thinking was for the gloopy ones, and that the oomny ones use like, inspiration and what Bog sends. Now it was lovely music that came into my aid. There was a window open with the stereo on, and I viddied right at once what to do.",
    "There was me, that is Alex, and my three droogs, that is Pete, Georgie, and Dim, Dim being really dim, and we sat in the Korova Milkbar making up our rassoodocks what to do with the evening.",
    "The boy has not a real choice, has he? Self-interest, the fear of physical pain drove him to that grotesque act of self-abasement. The insincerity was clear to be seen. He ceases to be a wrongdoer. He ceases also to be a creature capable of moral choice.",
    "I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same answers the rest of us want. Where did I come from? Where am I going? How long have I got?",
    "I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.",
    "I will need my spectacles and a clear head. Today I broke my rules and I drank vodka. Tomorrow I will translate it, and then I will bring what I've done to your home.",
    "I know that you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV, and then The Blair Witch Project was coming on Starz and you were like, \"I haven't seen this since it came out and if so we should watch it\" and then, \"but oh, no, we should just make out instead!\"",
    "I'm a hopeless dancer, but this looks like you just screw in a light bulb with one hand and pat the dog with the other. Watch yourself, Darcy, he's about to transform into the Indian MC Hammer!",
    "My darling, you have to be standing up in order to be able to fall. I mean, if you keep sitting on your ass, nothing's gonna happen. \"Only brave warriors fall off their horses in battle. How can kneeling cowards know what a fall is?\"",
    "Throughout my academic career, I'd given some pretty good talks. But being considered the best speaker in the Computer Science department is like being known as the tallest of the Seven Dwarfs.",
    "No matter how bad things are, you can always make things worse. At the same time, it is often within your power to make them better. I learned this lesson well on New Year's Eve, 2001.",
    "I was hugely impressed. Kirk, I mean Shatner, was the ultimate example of a man who knew what he didn't know, was perfectly willing to admit it, and didn't want to leave until he understood. That's heroic to me.",
    "Whenever you watch the mind, you withdraw consciousness from mind forms, and it then becomes what we call the watcher or the witness.

    "We don't need no education. We don't need no thought control. No dark sarcasm in the classroom - teachers leave them kids alone! All in all it's just another brick in the wall.",
    "We don't need no education. We don't need no thought control. No dark sarcasm in the classroom - teachers leave them kids alone! All in all it's just another brick in the wall. \"If you don't eat yer meat, you can't have any pudding. How can you have any pudding if you don't eat yer meat?\"",
    "Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day, you fritter and waste the hours in an off-hand way. Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town, waiting for someone or something to show you the way.",
    "Trudging slowly over wet sand, back to the bench where your clothes were stolen. This is the coastal town that they forgot to close down. Armageddon - come Armageddon, come.",
    "A little boy went out to play. When he opened his door, he saw the world. As he passed through the doorway, he caused a reflection. Evil was born, and followed the boy.",
    "There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have? So, let's just say I'm driving this buggy, and if you fix your attitude, you can ride along with me. Now you will see me one more time, if you do good. You will see me two more times, if you do bad.",
    "Now did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear, or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?",
    "Now I want you to think and stop being a smart aleck. A man's attitude goes some ways - the way his life will be. Is that something you agree with? So since you agree, you must be someone who does not care about the good life.",
    "My dog barks some. Mentally you picture my dog, but I have not told you the type of dog which I have. Perhaps you even picture Toto, from \"The Wizard of Oz.\" But I warn you, my dog is always with me. Woof!",
    "It's a sunny, woodsy day in Lumberton, so get those chainsaws out. This is the mighty WOOD - the musical voice of Lumberton. At the sound of the falling tree, it's 9:30. There's a whole lotta wood waiting out there, so let's get going.",
    "In the casino, the cardinal rule is to keep them playing and to keep them coming back. The longer they play, the more they lose, and in the end, we get it all. Running a casino is like robbing a bank with no cops around.",
    "What? A swallow carrying a coconut? It's not a question of where he grips it! It's a simple question of weight ratios! A five ounce bird could not carry a one pound coconut. Listen - in order to maintain air-speed velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings forty-three times every second, right?",
    "Listen, strange women lyin' in ponds distributin' swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.",
    "Everyone said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same, just to show them. It sank into the swamp. So I built a second one. That sank into the swamp. So I built a third. That burned down, fell over, then sank into the swamp. But the fourth one stayed up!",
    "King, eh? Very nice. And how'd you get that, eh? By exploiting the workers. By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the economic and social differences in our society.",

    "Look, you should admit to yourself that Microsoft will miss you for a month or two. Someone will quickly fill the void. It will be like you never worked there. Ask yourself, \"Are there thousands lining up to help poor villages build schools and libraries?\"",
    "Space is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly hugely mindbogglingly big it is. I mean you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to space.",
    "Is it really necessary to send that email? The more emails you send, the more work others will have to do to prioritize your requests. How many of the things you're mentioning are important? If you have 10 issues to discuss, break them into two groups and focus on the most important group.",
    "As if that blind rage had washed me clean, rid me of hope; for the first time, in that night alive with signs and stars, I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world.",
    "As if that blind rage had washed me clean, rid me of hope; for the first time, in that night alive with signs and stars, I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world. Finding it so much like myself, I felt that I had been happy and that I was happy again.",
    "Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes - they call me on and on across the universe. Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box - they tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.",
    "The place to improve the world is first in one's own heart and head and hands, and then to work outward from there. Other people can talk about how to expand the destiny of mankind. I just want to talk about how to fix a motorcycle. I think that what I have to say has more lasting value.",
    "If you're working out in front of a mirror and watching your muscles grow, your ego has reached a point where it is now eating itself. That's why I believe there should be a psychiatrist at every health club, so that when they see you doing this, they will take you away for a little chat.",
    "The chemistry of an element is determined by the manner in which its electrons are arranged in the atom. Such arrangements are the basis of the modern periodic classification of the elements: the Periodic Table.",
    "I thought climbing the Devil's Thumb would fix all that was wrong with my life. In the end, of course, it changed almost nothing. But I came to appreciate that mountains make poor receptacles for dreams. And I lived to tell my tale.",
    "Do you smell that? Napalm, son. Nothing else in the world smells like that. I love the smell of napalm in the morning. You know, one time we had a hill bombed, for twelve hours. Smelled like victory. Someday this war's gonna end.",
    "The inner surface of the cell wall touches the cytoplasmic membrane. The cytoplasmic membrane contains proteins that span the lipid bilayer. The bacterial cytoplasmic membrane (unlike that of animals) has no cholesterol or other sterols.",
    "If you are given too many choices, if you are forced to consider much more than your unconscious is comfortable with, you get paralyzed. Snap judgments can be made in a snap because they are frugal, and if we want to protect our snap judgments, we have to take steps to protect that frugality.",
    "\"This man right here,\" McGuinness said, pointing at Kenna, \"he's going to change the world.\" That was his instinctive feeling, and the manager of a band like U2 is a man who knows music.",
    "\"This man right here,\" McGuinness said, pointing at Kenna, \"he's going to change the world.\" That was his instinctive feeling, and the manager of a band like U2 is a man who knows music. But the people whose world Kenna was supposed to be changing, it seemed, couldn't disagree more.",
    "San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of. But no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world.",
    "The unknown future rolls toward us. I face it for the first time with a sense of hope, because if a machine, a Terminator, can learn the value of human life, maybe we can, too.",
    "If there is one thing the history of evolution has taught us it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free, expands to new territory, and crashes through barriers, painfully, maybe even dangerously.",
    "Maybe what I think Tasty Wheat tasted like actually tasted like oatmeal, or tuna fish. That makes you wonder about a lot of things. You take chicken, for example: maybe they couldn't figure out what to make chicken taste like, which is why chicken tastes like everything.",
    "The Orient was almost a European invention, and had been since antiquity a place of romance, exotic beings, haunting memories and landscapes, remarkable experiences. Now it was disappearing; in a sense it had happened, its time was over.",
    "We sit silently and watch the world around us. This has taken us a lifetime to learn. It seems only the old are able to sit next to one another and not say anything and still feel content. The young, brash and impatient, must always break the silence. It is a waste, for silence is pure.",
    "The time I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon me. What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people? What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked?",
    "The example of painting can teach us not only how to manage our own work, but how to work together. A lot of the great art of the past is the work of multiple hands, though there may only be one name on the wall next to it in the museum.",
    "Like painting, most software is intended for a human audience. And so hackers, like painters, must have empathy to do really great work. You have to be able to see things from the user's point of view.",
    "Popularity is only partially about individual attractiveness. It's much more about alliances. To become more popular, you need to be constantly doing things that bring you close to other popular people, and nothing brings people closer than a common enemy.",
    "Because they're at the bottom of the scale, nerds are a safe target for the entire school. If I remember correctly, the most popular kids don't persecute nerds; they don't need to stoop to such things. Most of the persecution comes from kids lower down, the nervous middle classes.",
    "It is greatly to America's advantage that it is a congenial atmosphere for the right sort of unruliness - that it is a home not just for the smart, but for the smart-alecks. And hackers are invariably smart-alecks. If we had a national holiday, it would be April 1st.",
    "It doesn't mean much to be able to filter out most present-day spam, because spam evolves. Indeed, most anti-spam techniques so far have been like pesticides that do nothing more than create a new, resistant strain of bugs.",
    "He's got a two day head start on you, which is more than he needs. Brody's got friends in every town and village from here to the Sudan, he speaks a dozen languages, knows every local custom, he'll blend in, disappear, you'll never see him again. With any luck, he's got the grail already.",
    "There are two places on Earth that serve as canaries in the coal mine - regions that are especially sensitive to the effects of global warming. The first is the Arctic. The second is the Antarctic.",
    "Warmer water increases the moisture content of storms, and warmer air holds more moisture. When storm conditions trigger a downpour, more of it falls in the form of big, one-time rainfalls and snowfalls.",
    "The problem we now face is that this thin layer of atmosphere is being thickened by huge quantities of human-caused carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. And as it thickens, it traps a lot of the infrared radiation that would otherwise escape the atmosphere and continue out to the universe.",
    "The brain can be a tool. But when you can't stop thinking of that math problem or phone number, or when troubling thoughts and memories arise without your intent, it's not your brain working, but your mind wandering. Then the mind controls you.",
    "If you don't get what you want, you suffer; if you get what you don't want, you suffer; even when you get exactly what you want, you still suffer because you can't hold on to it forever. Your mind is your predicament.",
    "Life is not suffering; it's just that you will suffer it, rather than enjoy it, until you let go of your mind's attachments and just go for the ride freely, no matter what happens.",
    "Hi, and welcome to the future. San Dimas, California, 2688. And I'm telling you, everything is great. The air is clean. The water is clean. Even the dirt is clean. Bowling averages are way up. Mini-golf scores are way down. And we have more waterslides than any other planet we communicate with.",
    "When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today I'm gonna read it to you.",
    "So my heart goes out to them. Figuratively. I would never actually entrust my heart to scientists - they'd probably implant it in a baboon. And a baboon with my heart would be practically unstoppable.",
    "Who has a safety deposit box full of money and six passports and a gun? Who has a bank account number in their hip? I come in here, and the first thing I'm doing is I'm catching the sightlines and looking for an exit.",
    "Anyway, like I was saying, shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute it. There's shrimp-kabobs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo. Pan fried, deep fried, stir-fried.",
    "I thought maybe I'd run to the end of town. And when I got there, I thought maybe I'd just run across Greenbow County. And I figured, since I run this far, maybe I'd just run across the great state of Alabama.",
    "I still see things that are not here. I just choose not to acknowledge them. Like a diet of the mind, I just choose not to indulge certain appetites; like my appetite for patterns; perhaps my appetite to imagine and to dream.",
    "Yes, the newspapers were right: snow was general all over Ireland. It was falling on every part of the dark central plain, on the treeless hills, falling softly upon the Bog of Allen and, farther westward, softly falling into the dark mutinous Shannon waves.",
    "I drew the blankets over my head and tried to think of Christmas. But the grey face still followed me. It murmured, and I understood that it desired to confess something. I felt my soul receding into some pleasant and vicious region; and there again I found it waiting for me.",

    "It was a marvelous night, the sort of night one only experiences when one is young. The sky was so bright, and there were so many stars that, gazing upward, one could not help wondering how so many whimsical wicked people could live under such a sky.",
    "I suddenly had the impression that I had been left all alone, that everyone was shrinking away from me, avoiding me. You are, of course, right to ask who that everyone is, for although I've lived in Petersburg for eight years now, I haven't managed to make a single friend.",
    "I'd been walking for hours and, as usual, I'd lost track of where I was, when I suddenly realized I'd reached the city limits. I immediately felt happy and, without hesitation, passed beyond the barrier and found myself walking between cultivated fields and meadows.",
    "Over the past decade, we've seen strong economic growth but anemic job growth; big leaps in productivity but flat-lining wages; hefty corporate profits, but a shrinking share of these profits going to workers.",
    "Some pilots like the excitement of our missions, knowing that they are of short duration, but most of us concentrate so fiercely on finding our targets and avoiding calamity that we recall more vividly our relief when it's over than we do our exhilaration while it's going on.",

    "You have a class of young strong men and women, and they want to give their lives to something. Advertising has these people chasing cars and clothes they don't need. Generations have been working in jobs they hate, just so they can buy what they don't really need.",
    "Advertising has these people chasing cars and clothes they don't need. Generations have been working in jobs they hate, just so they can buy what they don't really need.",
    "Chance and chance alone has a message for us. Everything that occurs out of necessity, everything expected, repeated day in and day out, is mute. Only chance can speak to us. We read its message much as gypsies read the images made by coffee grounds at the bottom of a cup.",
    "I've always wondered about this coat business. When I'm in a theater, I either fold mine in my lap or throw it over my armrest, but Patsy always spreads hers out, acting as if the seat back were cold, and she couldn't possibly enjoy herself while it was suffering.",
    "The only preventive thing I do is wash clothes after buying them in a thrift shop - this after catching crabs from a pair of used pants. I was in my midtwenties at the time and probably would have itched myself all the way to the bone had a friend not taken me to a drugstore.",
    "The only message I got was from the company that holds my student loan, Sallie Mae. Sallie Mae sounds like a naive and barefoot hillbilly girl but in fact they are a ruthless and aggressive conglomeration of bullies located in a tall brick building somewhere in Kansas.",
    "In order to become an elf I filled out ten pages' worth of forms, took a multiple choice personality test, underwent two interviews and a drug test. The first interview was general, designed to eliminate obvious sociopaths. During the second interview we were asked why we wanted to be elves.",
    "Who is Keyser Soze? He is supposed to be Turkish. Some say his father was German. Nobody believed he was real. The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.",
    "A glooming peace this morning with it brings. The sun for sorrow will not show its head. Go hence to have more talk of these sad things. Some shall be pardoned and some punished. For never was a story of more woe than this of Juliet and her Romeo.",
    "Tis but thy name that is my enemy. Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot, nor arm, nor face, nor any other part belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? That, which we call a rose by any other word would smell as sweet.",
    "When I really worry about something, I don't just fool around. I even have to go to the bathroom when I worry about something. Only I don't go. I'm too worried to go. I'm too worried to interrupt my worrying to go.",

    "We've known each other for many years but this is the first time you've ever come to me for counsel or for help. I can't remember the last time you invited me to your house for a cup of coffee, even though my wife is Godmother to your only child.",

    "Do I really look like a guy with a plan? You know what I am? I'm a dog chasing cars. I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it. You know, I just do things. I'm not a schemer. I try to show the schemers how pathetic their attempts to control things really are.",

    "I tensed, waiting for the fury - both his and mine - but it was only quiet and calm in the darkness of his room. I could almost taste the sweetness of reunion in the air.",
    "I felt dull and somnolent, for daytime sleep is like the sin of the flesh: the more you have the more you want, and yet you feel unhappy, sated and unsated at the same time.",
    "It led me by the hand, as if to fill the niches in the memories in my oozing brain fluid. Without even a destination, we kept walking. Disgusting clouds were floating in the sky. I already know what will happen to me the next time I wake up.",
    "You don't know what's in store, but you know what you're here for. Close your eyes, lay yourself beside me. Hold tight for this ride, we don't need no protection. Come alone, we don't need attention.",
    "I had felt it growing, this feeling that had been hiding beneath the surface for some time now. I'd seen him, this person who never intended to be seen, and my faulty, silly, useless heart kept whispering his name. I clutched my chest, feeling my heart racing.",

    "What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn't happen much, though.",
    "I think that if I ever have kids, and they are upset, I won't tell them that people are starving in China or anything like that because it wouldn't change the fact that they were upset. And even if somebody else has it much worse, that doesn't really change the fact that you have what you have.",
    "So, I guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.",
    "But you know that when the truth is told, you can get what you want or you can just get old; you're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through. When will you realize? Vienna waits for you.",

    "I'll dive in the sky. Oh, the waters alive! I'll float down to soak in the stars. Swim away from the night. I am swallowed by light. Suddenly, love doesn't seem very far.",
    "The man who pulls the lever that breaks your neck will be a dispassionate man, and that dispassion is the very essence of justice. For justice delivered without dispassion is always in danger of not being justice.",
    "And isn't that a minor miracle? The state of the world today and the level of conflict and misunderstanding, that two men could stand on a lonely road in winter and talk calmly and rationally while all around them, people are losing their mind. You have a nice day.",
    "Because some roads you shouldn't go down. Because maps used to say, \"there be dragons here.\" Now they don't. But that don't mean the dragons aren't there.",
    "Your problem is you spent your whole life thinking there are rules. There aren't. We used to be gorillas. All we had is what we could take and defend. The truth is, you're more of a man today than you were yesterday.",
    "As a child, I was aware that, at night, infrared vision would reveal monsters hiding in the bedroom closet only if they were warm-blooded. But everybody knows that your average bedroom monster is reptilian and cold-blooded.",

    "When things are going well with sales, profits, shareholder value, and management, discussion of this separation - so inimical to the basic tenets of capitalism - is muted. It creates little static.",
    "Antoon used to import paint cans. That's simply too expensive now, so he's taken to making his own. An educated man who is proud of what he's achieved, he shows how his workers recycle old oil can barrels, turning them into shiny containers for his open paint.",

    "Any one can get angry - that is easy - or give or spend money; but to do this to the right person, to the right extent, at the right time, with the right motive, and in the right way, that is not for every one, nor is it easy; wherefore goodness is both rare and laudable and noble.",
    "With people like us, you should hang out, get to know what they do, how they do it. No one is going to answer questions like that. You need to understand how young people live on the streets.",
    "Finally, don't expect your cooking to taste exactly like restaurant or packaged foods. For one, a lot of commercial cooking is designed to appeal to the palate via a salty, fatty, or sugary assault on the senses. Tasty? Yes. Healthy? Not exactly.",

    "Wicked phenomenon, yes? But, you know, it's not any more \"evil\" than, say... fire. It all depends on your point of view. Try to get a better understanding of things before you make your judgement. Let's move out now, it's not safe here.",
    "It appears that the devastation we brought upon ourselves was complete; Heaven, Hell and Purgatory were atomized as well. So when a soul leaves the body it has nowhere to go, and must remain here, in the Metro. A harsh, but not undeserved atonement for our sins, wouldn't you agree?",

    "For so long I thought that if my dad accepted me, I'd be happy. I'm back home now. My dad talks to me, he even thinks I'm a hero. Everything should be perfect, right? I should be happy now, but I'm not. I'm angrier than ever and I don't know why.",
    "Years ago, I was an angry young man. And I'd pretend that I was a billboard standing tall by the side of the road. I fell in love with a beautiful highway.",
    "Perhaps love is like a resting place, a shelter from the storm. It exists to give you comfort. It is there to keep you warm. And in those times of trouble when you are most alone, the memory of love will bring you home.",
    "Perhaps love is like a window, perhaps an open door. It invites you to come closer. It wants to show you more. And even if you lose yourself, and don't know what to do, the memory of love will see you through.",
    "People say these things because everyone holds fond memories of their time in high school; however, I doubt that every high school student would want to remember their school life that way. For example, if neither studying, nor sports, nor socializing are of interest to someone, what then?",
    "I hate nice girls. If they so much as say hello, it stays on my mind. If they return my texts, my heart races. The day one calls me, I know I'll look at my call history and grin. But I know that's just them being nice. People who are nice to me are also nice to everyone else.",

    "You know the difference between you and me Marty? I'm a white trash cracker from a white trash town that no one would even bother to piss on. But here's the difference. I've made something of myself, I have the keys to the capitol, people respect me. But you, you're still nothing.",
    "Oh, you think darkness is your ally. But you merely adopted the dark; I was born in it, molded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but blinding!",
    "That's when the pain comes in like a second skeleton trying to fit beneath the skin. I can't fit the feelings in. Every single night is a fight with my brain.",
    "History is not merely a linear collection of points that we pass through on a timeline. They are connected by a line. No, perhaps it is more accurate to say that they are made to connect.",
    "There was no reason for me to stay in the real world any longer. In the real world, it didn't matter if I was there or not. When I realized that, I was no longer afraid of losing my body.",

    "I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do.",
    "The following year, I left home to live in the school dormitory. My mother said the 12 years she spent raising us felt like an instant, as if it were a fairy tale. She said so happily with eyes fixed on a distant mountain peak. Seeing that smile on her face makes me very happy.",
    "You choose to be hurt rather than to hurt others, right? You're nice and wonderful. But while it seems like you are choosing both, you're really forsaking both.",
    "If there is a design or pattern on our china, we eat until we can see the design clearly. If you're on a diet, eat from plates with no design - or even better, from plain white china. Without the design present to influence you, you have less incentive to clean your plate.",
    "You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done!",
    "Yet the border between the United States and Mexico not only separates \"American\" from \"Latin American\" history. It also marks where Global North meets Global South, or as was once popular, where the First World meets the Third World.",

    "The general who became a slave. The slave who became a gladiator. The gladiator who defied an emperor. Striking story! But now, the people want to know how the story ends. Only a famous death will do. And what could be more glorious than to challenge the Emperor himself in the great arena?",
    "I search the faces of the gods... for ways to please you, to make you proud. One kind word, one full hug... where you pressed me to your chest and held me tight. Would have been like the sun on my heart for a thousand years. What is it in me that you hate so much?",
    "I think he knows what Rome is. Rome is the mob. Conjure magic for them and they'll be distracted. Take away their freedom and still they'll roar. The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the senate, it's the sand of the coliseum. He'll bring them death - and they will love him for it.",
    "I have been told of a certain sea snake which has a very unusual method of attracting its prey. It will lie at the bottom of the ocean as if wounded. Then its enemies will approach, and yet it will lie quite still. And then its enemies will take little bites of it, and yet it remains still.",

    "No battle is ever won. They are not even fought. The field only reveals to man his own folly and despair, and victory is an illusion of philosophers and fools.",
    "I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.",
    "I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun.",
    "Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.",
    "There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me.",
    "You are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. My affections and wishes are unchanged; but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever.",
    "I am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh.",
    "And I have one of those very loud, stupid laughs. I mean if I ever sat behind myself in a movie or something, I'd probably lean over and tell myself to please shut up.",
    "I'm the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life. It's awful. If I'm on my way to the store to buy a magazine, even, and somebody asks me where I'm going, I'm liable to say I'm going to the opera.",
    "I figured I could get a job at a filling station somewhere, putting gas and oil in people's cars. I didn't care what kind of job it was, though. Just so people didn't know me and I didn't know anybody.",
    "If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger.",
    "I have dreamt in my life, dreams that have stayed with me ever after, and changed my ideas; they have gone through and through me, like wine through water, and altered the color of my mind. And this is one: I'm going to tell it - but take care not to smile at any part of it.",
    "I love the ground under his feet, and the air over his head, and everything he touches and every word he says. I love all his looks, and all his actions and him entirely and all together.",
    "Heaven did not seem to be my home; and I broke my heart with weeping to come back to earth; and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the middle of the heath on the top of Wuthering Heights; where I woke sobbing for joy.",
    "I'm wearying to escape into that glorious world, and to be always there: not seeing it dimly through tears, and yearning for it through the walls of an aching heart: but really with it, and in it.",
    "Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power.",
    "Being in a minority, even in a minority of one, did not make you mad. There was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad.",
    "For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable - what then?",
    "Confession is not betrayal. What you say or do doesn't matter; only feelings matter. If they could make me stop loving you - that would be the real betrayal.",
    "I don't like work - no man does - but I like what is in the work - the chance to find yourself. Your own reality - for yourself not for others - what no other man can ever know. They can only see the mere show, and never can tell what it really means.",
    "No, it is impossible; it is impossible to convey the life-sensation of any given epoch of one's existence - that which makes its truth, its meaning - its subtle and penetrating essence. It is impossible. We live, as we dream: alone.",
    "Droll thing life is - that mysterious arrangement of merciless logic for a futile purpose. The most you can hope from it is some knowledge of yourself - that comes too late - a crop of inextinguishable regrets.",
    "You know I hate, detest, and can't bear a lie, not because I am straighter than the rest of us, but simply because it appalls me. There is a taint of death, a flavour of mortality in lies - which is exactly what I hate and detest in the world - what I want to forget.",
    "You must love your work, and not be always looking over the edge of it, wanting your play to begin. And the other is, you must not be ashamed of your work, and think it would be more honorable to you to be doing something else.",
    "Certainly the determining acts of her life were not ideally beautiful. They were the mixed result of young and novel impulse struggling amidst the conditions of an imperfect social state, in which great feelings will often take the aspect of error, and great faith the aspect of illusion.",
    "Only those who know the supremacy of the intellectual life - the life which has a seed of ennobling thought and purpose within - can understand the grief of one who falls from that serene activity into the absorbing soul-wasting struggle with worldly annoyances.",
    "The presence of a noble nature, generous in its wishes, ardent in its charity, changes the lights for us: we begin to see things again in their larger, quieter masses, and to believe that we too can be seen and judged in the wholeness of our character.",
    "They're talking about things of which they don't have the slightest understanding, anyway. It's only because of their stupidity that they're able to be so sure of themselves.",
    "I see, these books are probably law books, and it is an essential part of the justice dispensed here that you should be condemned not only in innocence but also in ignorance.",
    "It's sometimes quite astonishing that a single, average life is enough to encompass so much that it's at all possible ever to have any success in one's work here.",
    "If he stayed at home and carried on with his normal life he would be a thousand times superior to these people and could get any of them out of his way just with a kick.",
    "He also swore himself by a binding oath that whatever wife he married he would abate her maidenhead at night and slay her next morning to make sure of his honour.",
    "I was oppressed with a sense of vague discontent and dissatisfaction with my own life, which was passing so quickly and uninterestingly, and I kept thinking it would be a good thing if I could tear my heart out of my breast, that heart which had grown so weary of life.",
    "I think human beings must have faith or must look for faith, otherwise our life is empty. To live and not to know why the cranes fly, why children are born, why there are stars in the sky. You must know why you are alive, or else everything is nonsense, just blowing in the wind.",
    "Formerly, when I would feel a desire to understand someone, or myself, I would take into consideration not actions, in which everything is relative, but wishes. Tell me what you want and I'll tell you who you are.",
    "You know no one and no one knows you, and at the same time you don't feel like a stranger. But here you know everyone and everyone knows you, and yet you are a stranger.",
    "He always seemed to women different from what he was, and they loved in him not himself, but the man created by their imagination, whom they had been eagerly seeking all their lives; and afterwards, when they noticed their mistake, they loved him all the same.",
    "We all have too many wheels, screws and valves to judge each other on first impressions or one or two pointers. I don't understand you, you don't understand me and we don't understand ourselves.",
    "Difference in opinions has cost many millions of lives: for instance, whether flesh be bread, or bread be flesh; whether the juice of a certain berry be blood or wine.",
    "This made me reflect, how vain an attempt it is for a man to endeavor to do himself honor among those who are out of all degree of equality or comparison with him.",
    "When a great office is vacant, either by death or disgrace (which often happens), five or six of those candidates petition the emperor to entertain his majesty and the court with a dance on the rope; and whoever jumps the highest, without falling, succeeds in the office.",
    "Whoever could make two ears of corn, or two blades of grass, to grow upon a spot of ground where only one grew before, would deserve better of mankind, and do more essential service to his country, than the whole race of politicians put together.",
    "I walked awhile among the rocks: the sky was perfectly clear, and the sun so hot, that I was forced to turn my face from it: when all of a sudden it became obscure, as I thought, in a manner very different from what happens by the interposition of a cloud.",
    "When I look up, I see people cashing in. I don't see heaven or saints or angels. I see people cashing in on every decent impulse and every human tragedy.",
    "Morale was deteriorating and it was all Yossarian's fault. The country was in peril; he was jeopardizing his traditional rights of freedom and independence by daring to exercise them.",
    "If he needs a million acres to make him feel rich, seems to me he needs it 'cause he feels awful poor inside hisself, and if he's poor in hisself, there ain't no million acres gonna make him feel rich, an' maybe he's disappointed that nothin' he can do'll make him feel rich.",
    "It's our land. We were born on it, and we got killed on it, died on it. Even if it's no good, it's still ours. That's what makes ownership, not a paper with numbers on it.",
    "One man, one family driven from the land; this rusty car creaking along the highway to the west. I lost my land, a single tractor took my land. I am alone and bewildered.",
    "I was never more hated than when I tried to be honest. Or when, even as just now I've tried to articulate exactly what I felt to be the truth. No one was satisfied.",
    "Power doesn't have to show off. Power is confident, self-assuring, self-starting and self-stopping, self-warming and self-justifying. When you have it, you know it.",
    "I remember that I'm invisible and walk softly so as to not awaken the sleeping ones. Sometimes it is best not to awaken them; there are few things in the world as dangerous as sleepwalkers.",
    "I was looking for myself and asking everyone except myself questions which I, and only I, could answer. It took me a long time and much painful boomeranging of my expectations to achieve a realization everyone else appears to have been born with: That I am nobody but myself.",
    "And the mind that has conceived a plan of living must never lose sight of the chaos against which that pattern was conceived. That goes for societies as well as for individuals.",
    "I denounce because though implicated and partially responsible, I have been hurt to the point of abysmal pain, hurt to the point of invisibility. And I defend because in spite of it all, I find that I love.",
    "I felt that even when they were polite they hardly saw me, that they would have begged the pardon of Jack the Bear, never glancing his way if the bear happened to be walking along minding his business. It was confusing. I did not know if it was desirable or undesirable.",
    "Yes, they think we're dumb. They call us the common people. But I've been sitting here listening and looking and trying to understand what's so common about us.",
    "If only all the contradictory voices shouting inside my head would calm down and sing a song in unison, whatever it was I wouldn't care as long as they sang without dissonance.",
    "And let's remember that science isn't a game of chess, although chess may be played scientifically. The other thing to remember is that if we are to organize the masses we must first organize ourselves.",
    "It was as if that great rush of anger had washed me clean, emptied me of hope, and, gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars, for the first time, the first, I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe.",
    "I had been right, I was still right, I was always right. I had lived my life one way and I could just as well have lived it another. I had done this and I hadn't done that. I hadn't done this thing but I had done another.",
    "Mostly, I could tell, I made him feel uncomfortable. He didn't understand me, and he was sort of holding it against me. I felt the urge to reassure him that I was like everybody else, just like everybody else. But really there wasn't much point, and I gave up the idea out of laziness.",
    "I felt the urge to reassure him that I was like everybody else, just like everybody else. But really there wasn't much point, and I gave up the idea out of laziness.",
    "I've never really had much of an imagination. But still I would try to picture the exact moment when the beating of my heart would no longer be going on inside my head.",
    "At that time, I often thought that if I had had to live in the trunk of a dead tree, with nothing to do but look up at the sky flowing overhead, little by little I would have gotten used to it.",
    "Mother used to say that however miserable one is, there's always something to be thankful for. And each morning, when the sky brightened and light began to flood my cell, I agreed with her.",
    "I would rather not have upset him, but I couldn't see any reason to change my life. Looking back on it, I wasn't unhappy. When I was a student, I had lots of ambitions like that. But when I had to give up my studies I learned very quickly that none of it really mattered.",
    "I was assailed by memories of a life that wasn't mine anymore, but one in which I'd found the simplest and most lasting joys: the smells of summer, the part of town I loved, a certain evening sky, Marie's dresses and the way she laughed.",
    "Suffering has been stronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be. I have been bent and broken, but - I hope - into a better shape.",
    "Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rain upon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts. I was better after I had cried, than before - more sorry, more aware of my own ingratitude, more gentle.",
    "Pause you who read this, and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold, of thorns or flowers, that would never have bound you, but for the formation of the first link on one memorable day.",
    "I took her hand in mine, and we went out of the ruined place; and as the morning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge, so the evening mists were rising now, and in all the broad expanse of tranquil light they showed to me, I saw no shadow of another parting from her.",
    "I kissed her cheek as she turned it to me. I think I would have gone through a great deal to kiss her cheek. But, I felt that the kiss was given to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been, and that it was worth nothing.",
    "But the queen - too long she has suffered the pain of love, hour by hour nursing the wound with her lifeblood, consumed by the fire buried in her heart. His looks, his words, they pierce her heart and cling - no peace, no rest for her body, love will give her none.",
    "Duty bound, Aeneas, though he struggled with desire to calm and comfort her in all her pain, to speak to her and turn her mind from grief, and though he sighed his heart out, shaken still with love of her, yet took the course heaven gave him and turned back to the fleet.",
    "What good are prayers and shrines to a person mad with love? The flame keeps gnawing into her tender marrow hour by hour, and deep in her heart the silent wound lives on.",
    "My son, from whence this madness, this neglect of my commands, and those whom I protect? Why this unmanly rage? Recall to mind whom you forsake, what pledges leave behind.",
    "So ran the speech. Burdened and sick at heart, he feigned hope in his look, and inwardly contained his anguish. Aeneas, more than any, secretly mourned for them all.",
    "My meaning simply is, that whatever I have tried to do in life, I have tried with all my heart to do well; that whatever I have devoted myself to, I have devoted myself to completely; that in great aims and in small, I have always been thoroughly in earnest.",
    "It was a long and gloomy night that gathered on me, haunted by the ghosts of many hopes, of many dear remembrances, many errors, many unavailing sorrows and regrets.",
    "It is no worse because I write of it. It would be no better if I stopped my most unwilling hand. Nothing can undo it; nothing can make it otherwise than as it was.",
    "This was my only and my constant comfort. When I think of it, the picture always rises in my mind, of a summer evening, the boys at play in the churchyard, and I sitting on my bed, reading as if for life.",
    "And now, as I close my task, subduing my desire to linger yet, these faces fade away. But one face, shining on me like a Heavenly light by which I see all other objects, is above them and beyond them all. And that remains.",
    "Mature affection, homage, devotion, does not easily express itself. Its voice is low. It is modest and retiring, it lies in ambush, waits and waits. Such is the mature fruit. Sometimes a life glides away, and finds it still ripening in the shade.",
    "She belonged to a different age, but being so entire, so complete, would always stand up on the horizon, stone-white, eminent, like a lighthouse marking some past stage on this adventurous, long, long voyage, this interminable - this interminable life.",
    "Half the time she did things not simply, not for themselves; but to make people think this or that; perfect idiocy she knew for no one was ever for a second taken in.",
    "Once you fall, Septimus repeated to himself, human nature is on you. Holmes and Bradshaw are on you. They scour the desert. They fly screaming into the desert. The rack and the thumbscrew are applied. Human nature is remorseless.",
    "There are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1 and .12 and .112 and an infinite collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities.",
    "Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.",
    "\"Without pain, how could we know joy?\" This is an old argument in the field of thinking about suffering and its stupidity and lack of sophistication could be plumbed for centuries but suffice it to say that the existence of broccoli does not, in any way, affect the taste of chocolate.",
    "The pleasure of remembering had been taken from me, because there was no longer anyone to remember with. It felt like losing your co-rememberer meant losing the memory itself, as if the things we'd done were less real and important than they had been hours before.",
    "But I believe in true love, you know? I don't believe that everybody gets to keep their eyes or not get sick or whatever, but everybody should have true love, and it should last at least as long as your life does.",
    "The weird thing about houses is that they almost always look like nothing is happening inside of them, even though they contain most of our lives. I wondered if that was sort of the point of architecture.",
    "Sometimes I wondered if I was seeing the same things through my eyes that the rest of the world was seeing through theirs. Maybe there was a glitch in my brain.",
    "I've never tried to keep a specific person alive before, and it's much more troublesome than I would have believed. But that's probably just because it's you. Ordinary people seem to make it through the day without so many catastrophes.",
    "You can't see the changes we see, we who have been with him for so long. Do you think any of us want to look into his eyes for the next hundred years if he loses you?",
    "Purity in body and heart may please some - as for me, I make no boast. For, as you know, no master of a household has all of his utensils made of gold; some are wood, and yet they are of use.",
    "And high above, depicted in a tower, sat Conquest, robed in majesty and power, under a sword that swung above his head, sharp-edged and hanging by a subtle thread.",
    "You're right, I did lose a million dollars last year. I expect to lose a million dollars this year. I expect to lose a million dollars next year. You know, Mr. Thatcher, at the rate of a million dollars a year, I'll have to close this place in 60 years.",
    "You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you love 'em so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. Something to be played your way, according to your rules.",
    "And then what did he do? Did he train you? Did he rehearse you? Did he tell you exactly what to do, what to say? You were a very apt pupil too, weren't you? You were a very apt pupil! Well, why did you pick on me? Why me?",
    "I don't think we'd have any alternatives. There isn't a single aspect of ship operations that isn't under his control. If he were proven to be malfunctioning I wouldn't see how we'd have any choice but disconnection.",
    "Perhaps I'm just projecting my own concern about it. I know I've never completely freed myself from the suspicion that there are some extremely odd things about this mission. I'm sure you agree there's some truth in what I say.",
    "Some day, and that day may never come, I will call upon you to do a service for me. But until that day, consider this justice a gift on my daughter's wedding day.",
    "I went to the police, like a good American. These two boys were brought to trial. The judge sentenced them to three years in prison, and suspended the sentence.",
    "With the money they earn they'll be able to buy more police and political power. Then they come after us. Right now we have the unions and we have the gambling and those are the best things to have.",
    "I know now that it's over. I knew it then. There would be no way, Michael, no way you could ever forgive me, not with this Sicilian thing that's been going on for 2,000 years.",
    "I saw a strange thing today. Some rebels were being arrested. One of them pulled the pin on a grenade. He took himself and the captain of the command with him. Now, soldiers are paid to fight; the rebels aren't.",
    "There was this kid I grew up with; he was younger than me. Sorta looked up to me, you know. We did our first work together, worked our way out of the street. Things were good, we made the most of it. During Prohibition, we ran molasses into Canada, made a fortune, your father, too.",
    "You can have my answer now, if you like. My final offer is this: nothing. Not even the fee for the gaming license, which I would appreciate if you would put up personally.",
    "My brother, your father, he and I. Opposites. But I never doubted his love. He would do anything for me. But his temper clouded his judgement. I don't want to see the same thing happen to you.",
    "What's Joey Zasa got to do with this? Joey Zasa's a pazzo. Joey Zasa. Alright, you are what you are. It's in your nature. From now on you stick close to me. You don't go anywhere, you don't do anything, you don't talk to anyone without checking with me first, understand?",
    "Say to all of you, I have been treated this day with no respect. I've earned you all money. I've made you rich and I asked for little. Good. You will not give, I'll take! As for Don Corleone, well, he makes it very clear to me today that he is my enemy. You must choose between us.",
    "I know you're into banks and Wall Street, but everyone knows you're the final word, you're like the Supreme Court. All I want to do is protect you from these guys and your lawyers can't do that.",
    "Everyone gets everything he wants. I wanted a mission, and for my sins, they gave me one. Brought it up to me like room service. It was a real choice mission, and when it was over, I never wanted another.",
    "He was close, real close. I couldn't see him yet, but I could feel him, as if the boat were being sucked upriver and the water was flowing back into the jungle. Whatever was going to happen, it wasn't gonna be the way they call it back in Nha Trang.",
    "The days go on and on... they don't end. All my life needed was a sense of someplace to go. I don't believe that one should devote his life to morbid self-attention. I believe that one should become a person like other people.",
    "I called Betsy again at her office and she said maybe we'd go to a movie together after she gets off work tomorrow. That's my day off. At first she hesitated but I called her again and then she agreed.",
    "A question in your nerves is lit, yet you know there is no answer fit to satisfy, ensure you not to quit. To keep it in your mind and not forget that it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.",
    "And now the end is near, and so I face the final curtain. My friend, I'll say it clear. I'll state my case of which I'm certain, I've lived a life that's full. I traveled each and every highway, and more, much more than this, I did it my way.",
    "Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew, when I bit off more than I could chew. But through it all, when there was doubt, I ate it up and spit it out.",
    "Though my story's seldom told, I have squandered my resistance. For a pocketful of mumbles such are promises, all lies and jest. Still, a man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest.",
    "When I left my home and my family, I was no more than a boy in the company of strangers in the quiet of the railway station, running scared, laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go. Looking for the places only they would know.",
    "Now the years are rolling by me. They are rocking evenly. And I am older than I once was and younger than I'll be. But that's not unusual. No, it isn't strange after changes upon changes. We are more or less the same; after changes we are more or less the same.",
    "We want a good life with a nose for things, the fresh wind and bright sky to endure my suffering. I'm a hole without a key if I break my tongue. Oh, speaking of tomorrow, how will it ever come?",
    "Without a queen the locust swarm turned the ground to black. Descending like a shadowy tower on a fish's back and scattered the sticks who crawled like snakes in the sand as the red clay took the form of a lizard who rushed like a moth to the flame of my open hand.",
    "Messes of men in farmer poverty; not much for monks but we pretend to be. Share a silent meal and a pot of chamomile, gypsies like us should be stamped in solidarity. Hold you in my fond but distant memory while waiting for the Mother Hen to gather me who regretfully wrote.",
    "It's so easy to hate your brother, it should be hard. It's so easy to hate your friends. Why ain't it hard? Love and hate come in the deck together. Play your card, love or hate can rule your life forever.",
    "Now Lina, you've been reading all those fan magazines again! Now look Lina, you shouldn't believe all that banana oil Dora Bailey and the columnists dish out. Now try to get this straight: there is nothing between us. There has never been anything between us. Just air.",
    "All beauty comes from beautiful blood and a beautiful brain. If the greatnesses are in conjunction in a man or woman it is enough, the fact will prevail through the universe, but the gaggery and gilt of a million years will not prevail. Who troubles himself about his ornaments or fluency is lost.",
    "I sing the body electric, the armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them, they will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, and discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the soul.",
    "I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning, how you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn'd over upon me, and parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue to my bare-stript heart, and reach'd till you felt my beard, and reach'd till you held my feet.",
    "Don't your feet get cold in the winter time? The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine. It's hard to tell the night time from the day. You're losing all your highs and lows; ain't it funny how the feeling goes away?",
    "Growing to hate decisive moments, the only thing within a breath of real. So now I fall to my knees and beg in earnest to what powers may govern the sky. Just let me sleep one night without these dreams - these dreams that always haunt me.",
    "Come senators, congressmen please heed the call. Don't stand in the doorway don't block up the hall. For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled. There's a battle outside and it's ragin'. It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls. For the times they are a' changin'!",
    "I have half a mind to make you hurt, to make you bleed, to make you suffer. I swear, if you've touched her - oh, heaven, forgive what I would do to you, you monster. And think about your children? They'll never believe what you've done.",
    "Outside of two men on a train platform there's nothing in sight. They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track. The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright. She could still be there sleeping when I get back.",
    "Noontime, and I'm still pushing myself along the road, the darkest part into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put. Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening with my heart. I've made shoes for everyone, even you, while I go barefoot.",
    "I can't believe the things I see. The path that I have chosen now has led me to a wall, and with each passing day I feel a little more like something dear was lost.",
    "To pass beyond is what I seek, I fear that I may be too weak. And those are few who've seen it through to glimpse the other side, the promised land is waiting like a maiden that is soon to be a bride.",
    "And though it's always been with me, I must tear down the wall and let it be. All I am, and all that I was ever meant to be, in harmony, shining true and smiling back at all who wait to cross. There is no loss.",
    "This is the end, beautiful friend. This is the end, my only friend - the end of our elaborate plans, the end of everything that stands, the end. No safety or surprise, the end. I'll never look into your eyes, again.",
    "It's easy to get wrapped up in sharing everyday life with a partner. It's fun to get lost in love and romance. It's the best. But holding on to yourself while doing that is the most important thing.",
    "We all have life storms, and when we get the rough times and we recover from them, we should celebrate that we got through it. No matter how bad it may seem, there's always something beautiful that you can find.",
    "One of the most tragic things I know about human nature is that all of us tend to put off living. We are all dreaming of some magical rose garden over the horizon instead of enjoying the roses that are blooming outside our windows today.",

    "I would wear the blue overalls of the fieldworker and often wore round, rimless glasses known as Mazzawati teaglasses. I had a car, and I wore a chauffeur's cap with my overalls. The pose of chauffeur was convenient because I could travel under the pretext of driving my master's car.",

When you see someone down, now's the time to pick them up. Set our differences aside and never look back.",
    "And I am not frightened of dying, any time will do, I don't mind. Why should I be frightened of dying? There's no reason for it, you've gotta go sometime. If you can hear this whispering you are dying. I never said I was frightened of dying.",
    "It's been a hard day's night, and I'd been working like a dog. It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log. But when I get home to you I find the things that you do will make me feel alright.",
    "You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things. And it's worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything. So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone you know I feel okay.",
    "I took up my vocation, I was called by my nation. Without hesitation, my answer I gave. Now I am not wondering the things that I might have been. I'm no consolation to the forgotten brave.",
    "I know you're coming in the night like a thief, but I've had some time alone to hone my lying technique. I know you think that I'm someone you can trust, but I'm scared I'll get scared and I swear I'll try to nail you back up.",
    "Space ain't man's final frontier. Man's final frontier is the soul guided by someone more powerful than any human being. Someone felt but never seen. You will be surprised of what resides in your insides.",
    "All this time we wait on this shallow line for a martyr to save our lives when you can't. A warning sign, a lack in reaction time, mixed with a war to fight keeps us here. The tide is in. It's time we all learn to swim. These rooftops won't save our lives and nor did you. Everything's all right.",
    "Surely death has found me, it has kept a hold of me all this far. My actions will reveal, only time will tell. These passions start to slip away, memories flash like seconds in a day.",

    "And it says to you love when you can, cry when you have to, be who you must. That's a part of the plan. Await your arrival with simple survival and one day we'll all understand.",
    "I just told you the truth. I told you the truth the first time. You don't have to ask me again. I never do that. I always tell you the truth. If I did it, you would know. I took her out a couple of times.",
    "I just hope you're lying next to somebody who knows how to love you like me. There must be a good reason that you're gone. Every now and then I think you might want me to come show up at your door, but I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong.",
    "I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure 'cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major. I got my boys with me, at least those in favor. And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later.",
    "Soon I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one. Remember life and then your life becomes a better one. I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once. I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month.",
    "We lived at the carnival in summer. We scared ourselves to death on a ghost train. And just like every ferris wheel stops turning, I guess we had an expiration date so I won't say I love you, it's too late.",
    "Now that you're on someone else's shoulders, the winter winds are colder on my own. Maybe we will meet when we get older. Maybe we won't. So I won't say I love you if you don't. And no you don't. So I won't say I love you if you don't.",
    "You know how far I'm prepared to go. I will be a boat and row your beauty to the moon if that's okay with you. I hope you don't mind if I get lost inside your eyes. Please excuse me if I don't imply but I've just gotta let you know that.",
    "Baby, what's it gonna hurt if they don't know, makin' everybody think that we're solo. Just as long as you know you got me, and boy I got ya, 'cause tonight I'm making deals with the devil, and I know it's gonna get me in trouble. Just as long as you know you got me.",

    "I'm so in love with you. And I hope you know, darling, your love is more than worth its weight in gold. We've come so far my dear. Look how we've grown. And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old. Just say you won't let go.",
    "Welcome to the room of people who have rooms of people that they loved one day, docked away. Just because we check the guns at the door doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades.",

    "This mystery of use without consumption, of warmth without combustion, seems like magic, but was merely an ingenious application of the art now happily lost but carried to great perfection by your ancestors, of shifting the burden of one's support on the shoulders of others.",
    "It was Silver's voice, and before I had heard a dozen words, I would not have shown myself for all the world. I lay there, trembling and listening, in the extreme of fear and curiosity, for, in those dozen words, I understood that the lives of all the honest men aboard depended on me alone.",
    "Maybe I'm foolish, maybe I'm blind thinking I can see through this and see what's behind. Got no way to prove it, so maybe I'm blind. But I'm only human after all. Don't put your blame on me.",

    "When you have children, you always have family. They will always be your priority, your responsibility. And a man, a man provides. And he does it even when he's not appreciated, or respected, or even loved. He simply bears up and he does it. Because he's a man.",
    "Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armour yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.",
    "The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. If you would take a man's life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does not deserve to die.",
    "My brother has his sword, King Robert has his war hammer and I have my mind, and a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone if it is to keep its edge. That's why I read so much Jon Snow.",
    "Opening your eyes is all that is needing. The heart lies and the head plays tricks with us, but the eyes see true. Look with your eyes. Hear with your ears. Taste with your mouth. Smell with your nose. Feel with your skin. Then comes the thinking, afterward, and in that way knowing the truth.",
    "Quite a plan you boys cooked up here. Quite a plan. I'm not sure what upsets me more - that I have four employees that conspired to commit felony fraud, or that I have four employees that are so stupid I found out about it within 30 seconds. Hearing it out loud, the first one seems worse.",
    "My feeling is if you're the CEO of a company and you're dumb enough to leave your login info on a Post-it note on your desk, while the people that you ripped off are physically in your office, it's not a hack. It's barely social engineering. It's more like natural selection.",
    "In the past, all a King had to do was look respectable in uniform and not fall off his horse. Now we must invade people's homes and ingratiate ourselves with them. This family's been reduced to those lowest, basest of all creatures. We've become actors!",

    "Grandma used to give great nutritional advice: Eat your vegetables. Over the years, that simple suggestion has been replaced with a lot of complicated-sounding recommendations. Many people end up more confused than enlightened.",
    "The largest piece of our nutrition puzzle belongs to carbohydrates. These macronutrients are the most abundant compounds on Earth, forming the grass under your feet and the trees that fill the sky. They should constitute most of the foods you eat.",
    "Carbohydrates are formed when carbon dioxide and water come together in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll (the pigment that makes plants green). The chemical bonds of the carbohydrate lock in the energy of the sun. This energy is released when the human body burns plant food as fuel.",
    "After water, protein is the most plentiful substance in our body; it is an integral part of every living cell. In foods, protein usually comes packaged with fat, and the type of fat determines how \"healthy\" a protein source is.",
    "No matter how a program twists and turns to get out of itself, it is still following the rules inherent in itself. It is no more possible for it to escape than it is for a human being to decide voluntarily not to obey the laws of physics.",
    "Sliding-window flow controls are designed to provide reliable services in a more efficient way, using less network bandwidth for acknowledgments. The sliding-window technique basically lets the sender transmit multiple packets at a time and use the transmission channel as efficiently as possible.",

    "In synchronous communications, the sender and receiver must synchronize with one another before data is sent. To maintain clock synchronization over long periods, a special bit-transition pattern is embedded in the digital signal that assists in maintaining the timing between sender and receiver.",
    "A vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction. Recall that a scalar, unlike a vector, has only magnitude and no direction. In mechanics, quantities such as force, velocity, acceleration, and momentum are vectors, and you must consider both their magnitude and direction.",
    "Studies suggest that the influence of parents is due to two factors: communication and receptivity. Parents communicate their feelings and preferences to children constantly. Because children have such a strong desire for parental approval, they are very receptive to their parents' views.",
    "As the United States assumed greater status as a power in world politics, Americans came to believe that the nation's actions on the world stage should be guided by American political and moral principles.",
    "Thousands of groups exist to influence government. Among the major types of interest groups are those that represent the main sectors of the economy. In addition, many public-interest organizations have been formed to represent the needs of the general citizenry, including some single-issue groups.",

    "And now for a brief public service announcement: alligators. Can they kill your children? Yes. Along those lines, to get personal for a moment, I think the best way to die would be: swallowed by a giant snake. Going feet first and whole into a slimy maw would give your life perfect symmetry.",

    "Bell ducked under it. Ellis' balled knuckles burned across his scalp. He ducked lower, seized Ellis, and used the heavier man's momentum to drive him at Clayton, who was rising to his feet. The house dicks' faces met nose to nose, mashing cartilage and cracking bone.",
    "Now look at this picture. Look at it hard. Then turn the page. Quiz about the page before. How many wheels on the Cat's wagon? Was there a flag in the house? Was the Cat holding his umbrella? Did the big yellow animal have blue dots? If YOU owned the big yellow animal, what would you call it?",
    "I know what you think it means, sonny. To me, it's just a made up word. A politician's word, so young fellas like yourself can wear a suit and a tie, and have a job. What do you really want to know? Am I sorry for what I did?",

    "The TV ad featured Jamie on drums, bashing out a pukka rhythm and wearing a gummy open-mouthed grin, like a drunk who's just kicked his own teeth out and thinks it's hilarious. It caused many to regard Mr. Oliver with a level of contempt normally reserved for war criminals.",

    "What could there be about a shadow that was so terrible that she knew that there had never been before or ever would be again, anything that would chill her with a fear that was beyond shuddering, beyond crying or screaming, beyond the possibility of comfort?",
    "I have no idea how I untangled the complicated process of words and thought, but it happened quickly and naturally. By the time I was two, all my memories had words, and all my words had meanings.",
    "Maybe I'm not so different from everyone else after all. It's like somebody gave me a puzzle, but I don't have the box with the picture on it. So I don't know what the final thing is supposed to look like. I'm not even sure if I have all the pieces.",
    "Now that I look back, I don't know why I was so stressed about it all this time. Funny how sometimes you worry a lot about something and it turns out to be nothing.",
    "The things we do outlast our mortality. The things we do are like monuments that people build to honor heroes after they've died. They're like the pyramids that the Egyptians built to honor the pharaohs. Only instead of being made of stone, they're made out of the memories people have of you.",
    "Some things you just can't explain. You don't even try. You don't know where to start. All your sentences would jumble up like a giant knot if you opened your mouth. Any words you used would come out wrong.",
    "What's cool about really little kids is that they don't say stuff to try to hurt your feelings, even though sometimes they do say stuff that hurts your feelings. But they don't actually know what they're saying. Big kids, though: they know what they're saying. And that is definitely not fun for me.",
    "But I really believe that there are more good people on this earth than bad people, and the good people watch out for each other and take care of each other.",
    "Sometimes you never feel meaner than the moment you stop being mean. It's like how turning on a light makes you realize how dark the room had gotten. And the way you usually act, the things you would have normally done, are like these ghosts that everyone can see but pretends not to.",
    "Some feeling had started in my stomach and was traveling up to my face, and I knew that when it got there I would turn bright red and hear the ocean, which is what happens when I get put on the spot.",
    "Well, let me tell you something, Caveman. You are here on account of one person. If it wasn't for that person, you wouldn't be here digging holes in the hot sun. You know who that person is?",

    "Higher and higher he climbed. His strength came from somewhere deep inside himself and also seemed to come from the outside as well. After focusing on Big Thumb for so long, it was as if the rock had absorbed his energy and now acted like a kind of giant magnet pulling him toward it.",
    "Stanley spent more time pushing the wheelbarrow than digging, because he was such a slow digger. He carted away the excess dirt and dumped it into previously dug holes. He was careful not to dump any of it in the hole where the gold tube was actually found.",
    "There is so much darkness in Ember, Lina. It's not just outside, it's inside us, too. Everyone has some darkness inside. It's like a hungry creature. It wants and wants and wants with a terrible power. And the more you give it, the bigger and hungrier it gets.",
    "The main thing to do is pay attention. Pay close attention to everything, notice what no one else notices. Then you'll know what no one else knows, and that's always useful.",
    "What you need to learn, children, is the difference between right and wrong in every area of life. And once you learn the difference, you must always choose the right.",
    "What was the power that turned the worm into a moth? It was greater than any power the Builders had had, he was sure of that. The power that ran the city of Ember was feeble by comparison.",
    "Did it matter then, she asked herself, walking towards bond street, did it matter that she must inevitably cease completely; all this must go on without her; did she resent it; or did it not become consoling to believe that death ended absolutely?",
    "Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious! Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious. If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious. Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!",
    "Inadequate ventilation of poultry houses results in a build-up of ammonia gas from poultry faeces, which contain urea. This can predispose the poultry to respiratory disorders, such as sneezing, running eyes and mucous discharges from the mouth. Providing good ventilation easily prevents this.",
    "In Ghana agriculture accounts for 35% of GDP and 36% of export earnings and employs more than 60% of the labor force. Given the sector's initial size and its importance for incomes and foreign exchange earnings, agriculture is likely to play a key role in Ghana's economic transformation.",
    "Ghana is passing through a demographic transition, and the reduction in its population growth will translate into a decreasing dependency ratio. In Ghana, the working-age population currently represents just over half the population and is increasing.",

    "Reading is not a natural process; the habits necessary for efficient reading must be learned. The habits and the skills involved in effective reading should be acquired during the initial period of reading instruction.",
    "There's a club if you'd like to go. You could meet somebody who really loves you. So you go and you stand on your own and you leave on your own and you go home and you cry and you want to die.",
    "Every breath you take and every move you make, every bond you break, every step you take, I'll be watching you. Every single day and every word you say, every game you play, every night you say, I'll be watching you.",
    "I bet you're wondering how I knew about your plans to make me blue with some other guy you knew before. Between the two of us guys, you know I loved you more.",
    "How can I just let you walk away, just let you leave without a trace? When I stand here taking every breath with you, you're the only one who really knew me at all.",
    "I wish I could just make you turn around and see me cry. There's so much I need to say to you. So many reasons why you're the only one who really knew me at all.",
    "Remember the day I set you free, I told you you could always count on me. From that day on, I made a vow. I'll be there when you want me, some way, some how.",
    "A long, long time ago, I can still remember how that music used to make me smile. And I knew if I had my chance that I could make those people dance, and maybe they'd be happy for a while.",
    "Spend all your time waiting for that second chance, for a break that would make it okay. There's always some reason to feel not good enough and it's hard at the end of the day.",
    "You fill up my senses like a night in the forest, like the mountains in springtime, like a walk in the rain, like a storm in the desert, like a sleepy blue ocean.",
    "Come let me love you, let me give my life to you, let me drown in your laughter, let me die in your arms, let me lay down beside you, let me always be with you.",
    "I don't care who you are, where you're from, what you did, as long as you love me. Every little thing that you have said and done feels like it's deep within me. Doesn't really matter if you're on the run, it seems like we're meant to be.",
    "I've tried to hide it so that no one knows, but I guess it shows. When you look into my eyes, what you did and where you are coming from, I don't care as long as you love me.",
    "For all those times you stood by me, for all the truth that you made me see, for all the joy you brought to my life, for all the wrong that you made right.",
    "You gave me wings and made me fly, you touched my hand. I could touch the sky. I lost my faith, you gave it back to me, you said no star was out of reach.",
    "Give me a lifetime of promises and a world of dreams. Speak the language of love like you know what it means. You're simply the best, better than all the rest, better than anyone I ever met.",
    "In your heart I see the start of every night and every day. In your eyes I get lost, I get washed away. Just as long as I'm here in your arms I could be in no better place.",
    "All of these moments just might find their way into my dreams tonight. But I know that they'll be gone when the morning light sings and brings new things.",
    "If all these dreams might find their way into my day to day scene I'd be under the impression I was somewhere in between. Not so many things we got to do or places we got to be.",
    "How can you see into my eyes like open doors leading you down into my core where I've become so numb without a soul. My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold until you find it there and lead it back home.",
    "Though I never knew you at all, you had the grace to hold yourself while those around you crawled. They crawled out of the woodwork and they whispered into your brain. They set you on the treadmill and they made you change your name.",
    "It seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind, never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in. And I would have liked to have known you but I was just a kid.",
    "Like a river flows surely to the sea, darling so it goes. Some things are meant to be. Take my hand, take my whole life too, for I can't help falling in love with you.",
    "On the day that you were born the angels got together and decided to create a dream come true. So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold and starlight in your eyes of blue.",
    "There was a little boy once upon a time who in spite of his young age and small size knew his mind. For every copper penny and clover he would find, he'd make a wish for better days and the end of hard times.",
    "You are older than me. Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal? Your eyes have died but you see more than I. You're a star in the face of the sky.",
    "I must have left my house at eight because I always do. My train, I'm certain, left the station when it was due. I must have read the morning paper going into town, and having gotten through the editorial no doubt I must have frowned.",
    "Sitting in the morning sun, I'll be sitting when the evening comes. Watching the ships roll in, and I watch them roll away again. Sitting on the dock of the bay, watching the tide roll away. I'm just sitting on the dock of the bay wasting time.",
    "People running everywhere, don't know the way to go, don't know where I am. Can't see past the next step, don't have to think past the last mile, have no time to look around. Just run around, run around and think why.",
    "I was once like you are now, and I know that it's not easy to be calm when you've found something going on. But take your time, think a lot. I think of everything you've got, for you will still be here tomorrow but your dreams may not.",
    "It's not time to make a change. Just sit down and take it slowly. You're still young, that's your fault, there's so much you have to go through. Find a girl, settle down. If you want, you can marry. Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy.",
    "All the times that I've cried, keeping all the things I knew inside. And it's hard, but it's harder to ignore it. If they were right I'd agree, but it's them they know, not me. Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away.",
    "Come and hold my hand. I want to contact the living. Not sure I understand this role I've been given. I sit and talk to God and he just laughs at my plans. My head speaks a language I don't understand.",
    "Fools rush in where angels fear to tread. And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head. Though I see the danger there, if there's a chance for me then I don't care.",
    "Fools rush in where wise men never go, but wise men never fall in love so how are they to know? When we met I felt my life begin. So open up your heart and let this fool rush in.",
    "I've seen places, faces and smiled for a moment. But oh, you haunted me so. Still my tongue tied, young pride would not let my love for you show in case you say no.",
    "I feel drunk but I'm sober, I'm young and I'm underpaid. I'm tired but I'm working. I care but I'm restless, I'm here but I'm really gone. I'm wrong and I'm sorry, baby.",
    "What it all comes down to is that everything is going to be quite alright. 'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket and the other one is flicking a cigarette.",
    "And the hardest part was letting go, not taking part was the hardest part. And the strangest thing was waiting for that bell to ring. It was the strangest start.",
    "Have I told you lately that I love you? Have I told you there's no one above you? Fill my heart with gladness, take away all my sadness, ease my troubles, that's what you do.",
    "The road is long with many a winding turn that leads us to who knows where. But I'm strong, strong enough to carry him. He ain't heavy, he's my brother.",
    "Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow. Hello, I've just got to let you know, cause I wonder where you are and I wonder what you do. Are you somewhere feeling lonely? Or is someone loving you? Tell me how to win your heart, for I haven't got a clue. But let me start by saying I love you.",
    "When I was younger, so much younger than today, I never needed anybody's help in any way. But now these days are gone, I'm not so self-assured. Now I find I've changed my mind, I've opened up the doors.",
    "Now my life has changed in oh so many ways, my independence seems to vanish in the haze. But every now and then I feel so insecure, I know that I just need you like I've never done before.",
    "You know I'm just a fool who's willing to sit around and wait for you. But baby, can't you see there's nothing else for me to do? I'm hopelessly devoted to you.",
    "On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair, warm smell of colitas rising up through the air. Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light. My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim. I had to stop for the night.",
    "Last thing I remember, I was running for the door, I had to find the passage back to the place I was before. \"Relax,\" said the night man, \"We are programmed to receive. You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.\"",
    "I can't make you love me if you don't. You can't make your heart feel something it won't. Here in the dark in these final hours I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power.",
    "I'll close my eyes and then I won't see the love you do not feel when you're holding me. Morning will come and I'll do what's right. Just give me till then to give up this fight.",
    "I'd like to build the world a home and furnish it with love. Grow apple trees and honey bees and snow white turtle doves. I'd like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony. I'd like to hold it in my arms and keep it company.",
    "I've seen it all. I have seen the trees, I have seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze, I've seen a man killed by his best friend and lives that were over before they were spent. I've seen what I was and I know what I'll be. I've seen it all, there is no more to see.",
    "The light and the dark the big and the small. Just keep in mind you need no more at all. You've seen what you were and know what you'll be. You've seen it all, there is no more to see.",
    "I hope you never lose your sense of wonder. You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger. May you never take one single breath for granted, God forbid love ever leave you empty handed.",
    "I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean. Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens. Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance when you get the choice to sit it out or dance.",
    "I don't know what it is that makes me love you so. I only know I never want to let you go 'cause you started something. Can't you see that ever since we met you've had a hold on me?",
    "It doesn't matter where you go or what you do, I want to spend each moment of the day with you. Look what has happened with just one kiss, I never knew that I could be in love like this.",
    "You stopped and smiled at me, asked me if I'd care to dance. I fell into your open arms and I didn't stand a chance. Now listen honey, I just want to be beside you everywhere.",
    "I have climbed the highest mountains, I have run through the fields. I have run, I have crawled, I have scaled these city walls, but I still haven't found what I'm looking for.",
    "If I ruled the world, every man would see the world was his friend. There'd be happiness that no man could end, no my friend, not if I ruled the world. Every hand would be held up high, there'd be sunshine in everyone's sky.",
    "If I were a rich man, I'd build a big tall house with rooms by the dozen right in the middle of the town. A fine tin roof with real wooden floors below. There would be one long staircase just going up and one even longer coming down and one more leading nowhere, just for show.",
    "I guess this time you're really leaving. I heard your suitcase say goodbye. Well, as my broken heart lies bleeding you say true love is suicide. You say you've cried a thousand rivers and now you're swimming for the shore. You left me drowning in my tears and you won't save me anymore.",
    "I took a walk along last night, I looked up at the stars to try and find an answer in my life. I chose a star for me, I chose a star for him, I chose two stars for my kids and one star for my wife.",
    "Imagine there's no heaven. It's easy if you try. No hell below us, above us only sky. Imagine all the people living for today. Imagine there's no countries. It isn't hard to do. Nothing to kill or die for and no religion too. Imagine all the people living life in peace.",
    "I hope some day you'll join us and the world will be as one. Imagine no possessions, I wonder if you can. No need for greed or hunger, a brotherhood of man. Imagine all the people sharing all the world.",
    "I've been down, now I'm blessed. I felt a revelation coming around. I guess it's right, it's so amazing, every time I see you I'm alive. You're all I've got, you lift me up. The sun and the moonlight, all my dreams are in your eyes.",
    "I wanna be inside your heaven. Take me to the place you cry from, where the storm blows your way. I wanna be earth that holds you. Every bit of air you're breathing in, a soothing wind, I wanna be inside your heaven.",
    "'Cause tonight for the first time at just about half past ten, for the first time in history it's gonna start raining men. It's raining men! Hallelujah it's raining men, amen!",
    "I'd sacrifice anything come what might for the sake of having you near in spite of a warning voice that comes in the night and repeats, repeats in my ear.",
    "Keep drinking coffee, stare me down across the table while I look outside. So many things I'd say if only I were able, but I just keep quiet and count the cars that pass by.",
    "I'm not the one who's lost with no direction, but you'll never see. You're so busy making masks with my name on them in all caps. You got the talking down, just not the listening.",
    "Today I don't feel like doing anything. I just wanna lay in my bed. Don't feel like picking up my phone so leave a message at the tone. 'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything.",
    "She dreams of 1969 before the soldiers came. The life was cheap on bread and wine and sharing meant no shame. She is awakened by the screams of rockets flying from nearby, and scared she clings onto her dreams to beat the fear that she might die.",
    "Before he leaves the camp he stops. He scans the world outside and where there used to be some shops is where the snipers sometimes hide. He left his home the week before. He thought he'd be like the police but now he finds he is at war. Weren't we supposed to keep the peace?",
    "Come here and take a lesson from the lovely lemon tree. Don't put your faith in love, my boy, I fear you'll find that love is like the lovely lemon tree.",
    "One day beneath the lemon tree, my love and I did lie. A girl so sweet that when she smiled the stars rose in the sky. We passed that summer lost in love beneath the lemon tree. The music of her laughter hid my father's words from me.",
    "One day she left without a word, she took away the sun. And in the dark she left behind, I knew what she had done. She'd left me for another, it's a common tale but true.",
    "I'm not proud, I was wrong and the truth is hard to take. I felt sure we had enough, but our love went overboard. Lifeboat lies lost at sea, I've been trying to reach your shore. Waves of doubt keep drowning me.",
    "For restless eyes egos burn and the mold is hard to break. Now we've waded in too deep and love is overboard. Heavy hearts, token words, all the hopes I ever had fade like footprints in the sand.",
    "I know there's something in the wake of your smile. I get a notion from the look in your eyes. You've built a love but that love falls apart. Your little piece of heaven turns too dark.",
    "I don't know where you're going and I don't know why but listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye. Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile. The precious moments are all lost in the tide.",
    "Maybe I will never be all the things that I wanna be. Now is not the time to cry, now's the time to find out why. I think you're the same as me, we see things they'll never see.",
    "There are times when all the world's asleep, the questions run too deep for such a simple man. Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned? I know it sounds absurd but please tell me who I am.",
    "You better lose yourself in the music, the moment. You own it, you better never let it go. You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow. This opportunity comes once in a lifetime.",
    "That's me in the corner, that's me in the spotlight losing my religion trying to keep up with you, and I don't know if I can do it. Oh no, I've said too much, I haven't said enough.",
    "I feel it in my fingers, I feel it in my toes. Love is all around me and so the feeling grows. It's written on the wind, it's everywhere I go. So if you really love me, come on and let it show.",
    "I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helping hand.",
    "The withered leaves collect at my feet and the wind begins to moan. Memory, all alone in the moonlight. I can dream of the old days, life was beautiful then. I remember the time I knew what happiness was. Let the memory live again.",
    "I must wait for the sunrise, I must think of a new life and I mustn't give in when the dawn comes. Tonight will be a memory too and a new day will begin, burnt out ends of smoky days.",
    "Just a cast away an island lost at sea. Another lonely day, no one here but me. More loneliness than any man could bear, rescue me before I fall into despair.",
    "A year has passed since I wrote my note but I should have known this right from the start: only hope can keep me together; love can mend your life but love can break your heart.",
    "Walked out this morning, I don't believe what I saw: a hundred billion bottles washed up on the shore. Seems I'm not alone in being alone. A hundred billion castaways looking for a home.",
    "I was working in the lab late one night when my eyes beheld an eerie sight. When my monster, from its slab, began to rise, and suddenly to my surprise he did the Mash, he did the Monster Mash. And it's a graveyard smash. He did the Mash, it caught on in a flash.",
    "From my laboratory in the castle east to the master bedroom where the vampires feast, the ghouls all came from their humble abodes to get a jolt from my electrodes.",
    "Well, the zombies were having fun. The party had just begun. The guests included the Wolfman, Dracula, and his son. The scene was rocking, all were digging the sound. Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds. The Coffin Bangers were about to arrive with their vocal group, The Crypt-Kicker Five.",
    "Saying \"I love you\" is not the words I want to hear from you. It's not that I want you not to say, but if you only knew how easy it would be to show me how you feel. More than words is all you have to do to make it real. Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me.",
    "Now that I've tried to talk to you and make you understand. All you have to do is close your eyes and just reach out your hands and touch me. Hold me close don't ever let me go.",
    "Morning has broken like the first morning, blackbird has spoken like the first bird. Praise for the singing, praise for the morning, praise for them springing fresh from the world.",
    "Sweet the rain's new fall, sunlit from heaven like the first dewfall on the first grass. Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden, sprung in completeness where his feet pass.",
    "We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files. We'd like to help you learn to help yourself. Look around you, all you see are sympathetic eyes. Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home.",
    "Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes, snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes, silver-white winters that melt into springs, these are a few of my favorite things.",
    "Near, far, wherever you are, I believe that the heart does go on. Once more you open the door and you're here in my heart and my heart will go on and on.",
    "Love can touch us one time and last for a lifetime and never let go till we're one. Love was when I loved you one true time I hold to in my life we'll always go on.",
    "There is some love that will not go away. You're here, there's nothing I fear and I know that my heart will go on. We'll stay forever this way, you are safe in my heart.",
    "Start spreading the news, I'm leaving today. I want to be a part of it, New York, New York. These vagabond shoes are longing to stray right through the very heart of it, New York, New York.",
    "They just use your mind and they never give you credit. It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it. Nine to five for service and devotion. You would think that I would deserve a fat promotion. Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me. I swear sometimes that man is out to get me.",
    "Yeah, they got you where they want you. There's a better life and you think about it, don't you? It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it and you spend your life putting money in his wallet.",
    "No matter what they call us, however they attack, no matter where they take us, we'll find our own way back. I can't deny what I believe, I can't be what I'm not. I know I'll love forever, I know no matter what.",
    "And I will keep you safe and strong and shelter from the storm. No matter where it's barren, a dream is being born. I'll be everyone you need, no matter if the sun don't shine or if the skies are blue. No matter what the end is my life began with you.",
    "When I look into your eyes I can see a love restrained. But darlin' when I hold you, don't you know I feel the same? Nothin' lasts forever and we both know hearts can change, and it's hard to hold a candle in the cold November rain.",
    "I'll light the fire, you place the flowers in the vase that you bought today. Staring at the fire for hours and hours while I listen to you. Play your love songs all night long for me, only for me.",
    "Come to me now and rest your head for just five minutes, everything is good. Such a cozy room, the windows are illuminated by the evening, sunshine through them, fiery gems for you, only for you.",
    "I see a line of cars and they're all painted black with flowers and my love, both never to come back. I see people turn their heads and quickly look away. Like a new born baby, it just happens every day.",
    "No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue. I could not foresee this thing happening to you. If I look hard enough into the setting sun, my love will laugh with me before the morning comes.",
    "Pauses, ellipses, the appearance and disappearance of commas, the placement (or absence) of speech prefixes - surely such tiny events have only the most trivial bearing on the literary or the theatrical design of the drama.",
    "For the same reasons that scientific standards change within each of the natural sciences, they differ extensively between them and across the divide between natural and social sciences. Indeed the differences between standards in the natural and social sciences must be wider than the others.",

    "It's a thousand pages, give or take a few. I'll be writing more in a week or two. I could make it longer if you like the style. I can change it round, and I want to be a paperback writer.",
    "It's a fallen situation when all eyes are turned in and a love isn't flowing the way it could have been. You brought it all on but it feels so wrong. You brought it all on. I don't believe this song.",
    "It's a sad communication with little reason to believe when one isn't giving and one pretends to receive. Pardon my heart if I showed that I cared, but I love you more than moments we have or have not shared.",
    "On the corner is a banker with a motorcar and little children laugh at him behind his back. And the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain, very strange.",
    "Now John at the bar is a friend of mine, he gets me my drinks for free. And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke, but there's someplace that he'd rather be.",
    "And the waitress is practicing politics as the businessmen slowly get stoned. Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness but it's better than drinkin' alone.",
    "Sometimes I wish I could turn back time, impossible as it may seem, but I wish I could so bad. Quit playing games with my heart. I live my life the way to keep you coming back to me. Everything I do is for you, so what is it that you can't see?",
    "I gave a letter to the postman, he put it in his sack. Bright and early next morning he brought my letter back. She wrote upon it, \"return to sender, address unknown. No such number, no such zone.\"",
    "Oceans apart day after day and I slowly go insane. I hear your voice on the line but it doesn't stop the pain. If I see you next to never how can we say forever?",
    "You know a dream is like a river ever changing as it flows and a dreamer's just a vessel that must follow where it goes. Trying to learn from what's behind you and never knowing what's in store makes each day a constant battle just to stay between the shores.",
    "Too many times we stand aside and let the waters slip away 'til what we put off 'til tomorrow has now become today. So don't you sit upon the shoreline and say you're satisfied. Choose to chance the rapids and dare to dance the tide.",
    "I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath, scared to rock the boat and make a mess. So I sat quietly, agreed politely. I guess that I forgot I had a choice. I let you push me past the breaking point. I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything.",
    "You held me down, but I got up, already brushing off the dust. You hear my voice, you hear that sound like thunder, gonna shake your ground. You held me down, but I got up. Get ready cause I've had enough. I see it all, I see it now.",
    "There's a fire starting in my heart reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark. Finally, I can see you crystal clear. Go ahead and sell me out, and I'll lay your ship bare. See how I'll leave with every piece of you. Don't underestimate the things that I will do.",
    "Baby, I have no story to be told, but I've heard one on you. Now I'm gonna make your head burn. Think of me in the depths of your despair. Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared.",
    "Throw your soul through every open door, count your blessings to find what you look for. Turn my sorrow into treasured gold. You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow.",
    "It's a human sign when things go wrong, when the scent of her lingers and temptation's strong. Into the boundary of each married man, sweet deceit comes calling and negativity lands.",
    "It's no sacrifice. Just a simple word. It's two hearts living in two separate worlds. Mutual misunderstanding after the fact. Sensitivity builds a prison in the final act.",
    "We lose direction, no stone unturned, no tears to damn you when jealousy burns. Cold, cold heart, hard done by you. Some things look better, baby, just passing through.",
    "She hangs her head and cries on my shirt. She must be hurt very badly. Tell me what's making you sad, Li? Open your door, don't hide in the dark. You're lost in the dark, you can trust me cause you know that's how it must be.",
    "Her eyes, like windows, trickle in rain upon the pain getting deeper, though my love wants to relieve her. She walks alone from wall to wall. Lost in her hall, she can't hear me, though I know she likes to be near me.",
    "She sits in a corner by the door. There must be more I can tell her if she really wants me to help her. I'll do what I can to show her the way, and maybe one day I will free her, though I know no one can see her.",
    "I am sailing home again. 'Cross the sea I am sailing stormy waters to be near you, to be free. I am flying like a bird 'cross the sky. I am flying, passing high clouds to be with you, to be free.",
    "If you're going to San Francisco be sure to wear some flowers in your hair. You're gonna meet some gentle people there. All across the nation, such a strange vibration. There's a whole generation with a new explanation.",
    "Nobody said it was easy. It's such a shame for us to part. Nobody said it was easy. No one ever said it would be this hard. Oh, take me back to the start.",
    "I let it fall, my heart, and as it fell you rose to claim it. It was dark and I was over until you kissed my lips and you saved me. My hands, they're strong, but my knees were far too weak to stand in your arms without falling to your feet.",
    "When I lay with you I could stay there. Close my eyes, feel you here forever. You and me together, nothing gets better. I set fire to the rain, watched it pour as I touched your face. Well, it burned while I cried, cause I heard it screaming out your name.",
    "Sometimes I wake up by the door, that heart you caught must be waiting for you. Even now when we're already over I can't help myself from looking for you.",
    "I'm gonna fight 'em off. A seven nation army couldn't hold me back. They're gonna rip it off. Taking their time right behind my back. And I'm talkin' to myself at night because I can't forget. Back and forth through my mind behind a cigarette.",
    "If I catch it comin' back my way I'm gonna serve it to you. And that ain't what you want to hear, but that's what I'll do. And the feeling coming from my bones says, \"Find a home.\"",
    "She may be the face I can't forget. The trace of pleasure or regret may be my treasure or the price I have to pay. She may be the song that summer sings. May be the chill the autumn brings. May be a hundred different things within the measure of a day.",
    "She may be the beauty or the beast. May be the famine or the feast. May turn each day into a heaven or a hell. She may be the mirror of my dream, a smile reflected in a stream. She may not be what she may seem inside her shell.",
    "She, who always seems so happy in a crowd, whose eyes can be so private and so proud. No one's allowed to see them when they cry. She may be the love that cannot hope to last. May come to me from shadows of the past that I'll remember till the day I die.",
    "She can kill with a smile, she can wound with her eyes, she can ruin your faith with her casual lies, and she only reveals what she wants you to see. She hides like a child, but she's always a woman to me.",
    "She can lead you to love, she can take you or leave you, she can ask for the truth, but she'll never believe. And she'll take what you give her as long as it's free.",
    "She takes care of herself, she can wait if she wants, she's ahead of her time. Oh, and she never gives out and she never gives in. She just changes her mind.",
    "She is frequently kind and she's suddenly cruel. She can do as she pleases, she's nobody's fool. But she can't be convicted, she's earned her degree, and the most she will do is throw shadows at you.",
    "Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown, picks up the letter that's lying there. Standing alone at the top of the stairs, she breaks down and cries to her husband.",
    "Meet me in the crowd, people. Throw your love around, love me. Take it into town, happy. Put it in the ground where the flowers grow, gold and silver shine.",
    "I walk a mile with a smile and I don't know, I don't care where I am, but I know it's alright. Jump the tracks, can't get back. I don't know anyone around here, but I'm safe this time, cause when you tell me stupid things, like you do, I have to change the rules.",
    "Fortunately you have got someone who relies on you. We started out as friends, but the thought of you just caves me in. The symptoms are so deep. It is much too late to turn away. We started out as friends.",
    "Time I'm sure will bring disappointments in so many things. It seems to be the way when you're gambling cards on love you play. I'd rather be in hell with you, baby, than in cool heaven.",
    "Let the stormy clouds chase everyone from the place. Come on with the rain. I've a smile on my face. I walk down the lane with a happy refrain just singin', singin' in the rain.",
    "Turn me loose from your hands, let me fly to distant lands over green fields, trees and mountains, flowers and forest fountains. Home along the lanes of the skyway.",
    "For this dark and lonely room projects a shadow cast in gloom, and my eyes are mirrors of the world outside. Thinking of the way that the wind can turn the tide, and these shadows turn from purple into grey.",
    "Just let me wake up in the morning to the smell of new mown hay, to laugh and cry, to live and die in the brightness of my day. I want to hear the pealing bell of distant churches sing. But most of all please free me from this aching metal ring and open out this cage towards the sun.",
    "What have I got to do to make you love me? What have I got to do to make you care? What do I do when lightning strikes me and I wake to find that you're not there?",
    "It's a sad, sad situation, and it's getting more and more absurd. Why can't we talk it over? Oh it seems to me that sorry seems to be the hardest word.",
    "Where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find. I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind. Whatever happened to our love? I wish I understood. It used to be so nice, it used to be so good.",
    "The hills are alive with the sound of music, with songs they have sung for a thousand years. The hills fill my heart with the sound of music. My heart wants to sing every song it hears.",
    "My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds that rise from the lake to the trees. My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies from a church on a breeze, to laugh like a brook when it trips and falls over stones on its way, to sing through the night like a lark who is learning to pray.",
    "There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold and she's buying a stairway to heaven. When she gets there she knows if the stores are all closed with a word she can get what she came for.",
    "There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings, sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.",
    "There's a feeling I get when I look to the west and my spirit is crying for leaving. In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees and the voices of those who stand looking.",
    "And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune, then the piper will lead us to reason and a new day will dawn for those who stand long and the forests will echo with laughter.",
    "If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now, it's just a spring clean for the May queen. Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run there's still time to change the road you're on.",
    "And as we wind on down the road, our shadows taller than our soul, there walks a lady we all know who shines white light and wants to show how everything still turns to gold. And if you listen very hard the tune will come to you at last.",
    "When the night has come and the land is dark and the moon is the only light we'll see, no I won't be afraid, oh, I won't be afraid just as long as you stand, stand by me.",
    "If the sky that we look upon should tumble and fall, or the mountain should crumble to the sea, I won't cry. No, I won't shed a tear just as long as you stand by me.",
    "No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low. That is, you know, you can't tune it. But it's all right, that is, I think it's not too bad.",
    "Have you seen the old man in the closed down market, picking up the papers with his worn out shoes? In his eyes you see no pride and hanging loosely at his side yesterday's paper, telling yesterday's news.",
    "In the all night cafe at a quarter past eleven, same old man sitting there on his own, looking at the world over the rim of his teacup, and each tea lasts an hour and he wanders home alone.",
    "How can you tell me that you're lonely and say for you that the sun don't shine? Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London. I'll show you something to make you change your mind.",
    "Where it began, I can't begin to know, but then I know it's growing strong. Was in the spring, then spring became the summer. Who'd have believed you'd come along?",
    "Look at the night and it don't seem so lonely. We filled it up with only two, and when I hurt, hurting runs off my shoulder. How can I hurt when I'm holding you?",
    "At the doorway on my heart all the leaves are falling down, and though I try to pick them up there's so many I think I'll drown. Ten days have come and gone, ten days and I'm all alone, and all that I can do is pray and pray.",
    "And if I should ever go away, well, then close your eyes and try to feel the way we do today, and then if you can remember, keep smiling, keep shining, knowing you can always count on me for sure. That's what friends are for.",
    "For the times when we're apart, well, then close your eyes and know these words are coming from my heart and then if you can remember in good times and bad times I'll be on your side forevermore.",
    "There are places I'll remember all my life, though some have changed. Some forever, not for better. Some have gone and some remain. All these places have their moments with lovers and friends I still can recall.",
    "These memories lose their meaning when I think of love as something new, though I know I'll never lose affection for people and things that went before. I know I'll often stop and think about them.",
    "This used to be my playground, this used to be my childhood dream, this used to be the place I ran to whenever I was in need of a friend. Why did it have to end?",
    "Sometimes you picture me. I'm walking too far ahead, you're calling to me, I can't hear what you've said. Then you say, \"Go slow.\" I fall behind, the second hand unwinds.",
    "After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray, watching through windows you're wondering if I'm okay. Secrets stolen from deep inside, the drum beats out of time.",
    "I am sitting in the morning at the diner on the corner. I am waiting at the counter for the man to pour the coffee, and he fills it only halfway, and before I even argue, he is looking out the window at somebody coming in.",
    "I open up the paper. There's a story of an actor who had died while he was drinking. He was no one I had heard of. And I'm turning to the horoscope and looking for the funnies when I'm feeling someone watching me.",
    "I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find is the love that I've found ever since you've been around. Your love's put me at the top of the world.",
    "Something in the wind has learned my name and it's telling me that things are not the same. In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze there's a pleasing sense of happiness for me.",
    "There is only one wish on my mind: when this day is through I hope that I will find that tomorrow will be just the same for you and me. All I need will be mine if you are here.",
    "Here comes the rain again, falling from the stars. Drenched in my pain again, becoming who we are. As my memory rests but never forgets what I lost. Wake me up when September ends.",
    "People say I'm crazy doing what I'm doing. Well, they give me all kinds of warnings to save me from ruin. When I say that I'm okay, well they look at me kinda strange. Surely, you're not happy now, you no longer play the game.",
    "People say I'm lazy, dreaming my life away. Well they give me all kinds of advice designed to enlighten me. When I tell them that I'm doing fine watching shadows on the wall.",
    "I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round. I really love to watch them roll. No longer riding on the merry-go-round, I just had to let it go.",
    "I've paid my dues time after time. I've done my sentence but committed no crime. And bad mistakes, I've made a few. I've had my share of sand kicked in my face, but I've come through.",
    "I've taken my bows and my curtain calls. You brought me fame and fortune, and everything that goes with it. I thank you all. But it's been no bed of roses, no pleasure cruise. I consider it a challenge before the whole human race, and I ain't gonna lose.",
    "There comes a time when we heed a certain call, when the world must come together as one. There are people dying and it's time to lend a hand to life, the greatest gift of all.",
    "We are the world, we are the children. We are the ones who make a brighter day, so let's start giving. There's a choice we're making. We're saving our own lives. It's true we'll make a better day, just you and me.",
    "Think of what you're saying, you can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright. Think of what I'm saying, we can work it out and get it straight or say good night.",
    "Life is very short, and there's no time for fussing and fighting, my friend. I have always thought that it's a crime, so I will ask you once again, try to see it my way. Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong.",
    "We didn't start the fire. It was always burning since the world's been turning. We didn't start the fire. No, we didn't light it, but we tried to fight it.",
    "I can hear the soft breathing of the girl that I love as she lies here beside me asleep with the night. And her hair, in a fine mist floats on my pillow, reflecting the glow of the winter moonlight.",
    "My life seems unreal, my crime an illusion, a scene badly written in which I must play. Yet I know as I gaze at my young love beside me the morning is just a few hours away.",
    "Always seems to me you only see what people want you to see. How long's it gonna be before we get on the bus and cause no fuss? Get a grip on yourself, it don't cost much.",
    "I don't want to talk about the things we've gone through. Though it's hurting me, now it's history. I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too. Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.",
    "The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice. And someone way down here loses someone dear. The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall. It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain?",
    "What would you think if I sang out of tune? Would you stand up and walk out on me? Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song and I'll try not to sing out of key. Oh I get by with a little help from my friends.",
    "See the stone set in your eyes, see the thorn twist in your side. I wait for you. Sleight of hand and twist of fate. On a bed of nails she makes me wait. And I wait without you.",
    "I see trees of green, red roses too, I see them bloom for me and you, and I think to myself what a wonderful world. I see skies of blue and clouds of white, the bright blessed day, the dark sacred night, and I think to myself what a wonderful world.",
    "The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky are also on the faces of people going by. I see friends shaking hands saying \"how do you do?\" They're really saying \"I love you.\"",
    "Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you. By now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do. I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now.",
    "Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away. Now it looks as though they're here to stay. Oh, I believe in yesterday. Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be. There's a shadow hanging over me. Oh, yesterday came suddenly.",
    "Young man, there's no need to feel down. I said, young man, pick yourself off the ground. I said, young man, 'cause you're in a new town, there's no need to be unhappy.",
    "So now I have to decide. Decide whether to let the world be ground under your heel all because I played by my rules. I'm trying to decide. I'm going to kill you. But I need to decide how far I'm willing to go.",
    "People won't be people when you hear this sound, that's been glowing in the dark at the edge of the town. People won't be people, no, the people won't be people when they hear this sound. Won't you show me what begins at the edge of the town?",
    "If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room would you trust it? I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when you're in the mood for empathy, there's blood on my pen.",
    "These are my books. I like stories with magic powers in them. Either in kingdoms on Earth or on foreign planets. Usually I prefer a girl hero, but not always.",
    "Once you free your mind about a concept of harmony and music being correct you can do whatever you want. So, nobody told me what to do, and there was no preconception of what to do.",
    "Lieutenant Dan got me invested in some kind of fruit company. So then I got a call from him, saying we don't have to worry about money no more. And I said, \"That's good! One less thing.\"",
    "Demons run when a good man goes to war. Night will fall and drown the sun when a good man goes to war. Friendship dies and true love lies. Night will fall and the dark will rise when a good man goes to war. Demons run but count the cost; the battle's won but the child is lost.",
    "With your feet on the air and your head on the ground, try this trick and spin it, yeah. Your head will collapse, but there's nothing in it, and you'll ask yourself \"Where is my mind?\"",
    "I still want to smack him. Or remind him that the last transfer we had from Abnegation, who is sitting right next to him, managed to knock out some of his teeth, so who knows what this next one will do.",
    "You may find yourself living in a shotgun shack, and you may find yourself in another part of the world, and you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile, and you may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife, and you may ask yourself, \"Well... how did I get here?\"",
    "Dani felt as if a path had appeared in front of him. It was temptingly lit, and offered a way out, up and away. But it was impossible to imagine taking the first step. It would mean leaping over a bottomless gulf out of which, once he'd fallen in, he'd never be able to climb again.",
    "If I had a highway, I would run for the hills. If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still. But you're giving me a million reasons. Giving me a million reasons about a million reasons.",

    "I don't think stand-up should really work on the page, so the very existence of this book is an indication of my ultimate failure as a comedian. The text of a stand-up set should be so dependent on performance and tone that it can't really work on the page, otherwise it's just funny writing.",
    "You may tell a tale that takes up residence in someone's soul, becomes their blood and self and purpose. That tale will move them and drive them and who knows what they might do because of it, because of your words. That is your role, your gift.",

    "Aravis also had many quarrels (and, I'm afraid, even fights) with Cor, but they always made it up again: so that years later, when they were grown up, they were so used to quarreling and making up again that they got married so as to go on doing it more conveniently.",

    "I never imagined a boy like you could give me so much trouble. It's unbelievable that you defeated my alter ego, Agahnim the Dark Wizard, twice! But I will never give you the Triforce. I will destroy you and make my wish to conquer both Light and Dark Worlds come true without delay.",
    "Yes, it was Link who helped me escape from the dungeon! When I was captive the wizard said, \"Once I have finished with you, the final one, the seal of the wise men will open.\"",
    "Surprisingly, the Triforce created this world to fulfill Ganon's wish. What is Ganon's wish, you ask? It is to rule the entire cosmos! Don't you think it might be possible with the power of the Triforce behind you?",
    "I once lived in the Lost Woods, until the day I wandered into a magic transporter. The power of the Dark World quickly turned me into this tree shape. I guess the two forests are connected with each other.",
    "Good afternoon. The Lakitu Bros., here reporting live from just outside the Princess's castle. Mario has just arrived on the scene, and we'll be filming the action live as he enters the castle and pursues the missing Power Stars. As seasoned cameramen, we'll be shooting from the recommended angle.",
    "Monsters are closing in! Throw your pack against them and push them back into the cage! A hostage will be slowly lowered into the flames! To save the day, you must hit the blue light, to raise the rope. Defeat all monsters before the hostage's goose is cooked!",
    "Step right on up, any of you who have the time and the courage! Our \"Super Dimension Warp\" is the invention of the century! To use it, jump up here... and you'll get teleported here! It's the masterwork of my beautiful daughter, Lucca.",
    "I'm Banta, the blacksmith. I'm forging a bell for the King to present to his beloved Queen Leene! I lost it when the Queen disappeared. I just couldn't keep working on the bell. But now it's back to business as usual!",
    "Anyway, I call this thing a \"Gate.\" It's a kind of portal, that takes you to the same location in a different era. Gates are very unstable, so I used the principle behind my Telepod device...",
    "All I asked was for you to behave like a princess. Even royalty must obey rules. Leave the rest up to the Chancellor and forget about the events in town.",
    "There's a diary. Here's the last page. It's all over. The fishmen attack if I make even the slightest noise. I'd rather have my gums scraped than have to fight these fiends.",
    "Welcome to the world of international intrigue where today's friend becomes tomorrow's foe. Even James Bond, with years of experience, has trouble keeping up with the shifting alliances. You can be sure of one thing only: the spy who loved you may also have a license to kill.",
    "In the old days of the Cold War, Zukovsky worked for the KGB. Over the years he had several ill-fated encounters with Bond, one of them resulting in a permanent limp. Now, Zukovsky operates an arms business out of St. Petersburg, and he is willing to sell information, even to Bond.",
    "For the days of my life have vanished like smoke, and my bones are parched like ash, and let all my impurities be as fuel for that fire until nothing remains but the light alone.",
    "And so we meet at last. You are to be commended for avoiding my traps. The work of a man who once had too much time on his hands, and now finds time for nothing but the work of salvation.",
    "Using the laser guide, you can steer your rocket past the gunship defenses and prevent it from shooting down your rocket. This will only anger it at first. But if you can survive long enough to make several direct hits, you will be rewarded with a prize worthy of any mantle piece.",
    "There is an old building up ahead. A bank or museum or something like that. Whatever the hell it used to be, now it is a nexus for Overwatch in City 17. It is the main source of pain for this part of town, thanks to a huge suppression device that rains down hell from the roof of the place.",
    "I received special training via a secret organization working under the direct control of the President. I was to assume the responsibility of protecting the new President's family.",
    "The disposal facility includes a hardened underground base. Even with our most advanced intelligence gathering equipment, we can't tell what's happening inside.",
    "Don't worry. That suit represents the latest advances in polythermal technology. The nuclear weapons disposal facility covers the whole island. I'll contact you by Codec after you reach your target.",
    "With gene therapy, we can remove those genes which we know may lead to sickness or disease, and at the same time, splice in genes with beneficial effects such as resistance to cancer for example.",
    "We'll use a process that I discovered called gene targeting. The strongest soldiers don't become what they are by acquiring their skills through training or experience, we now know that hereditary factors are far more crucial for creating superior soldiers.",
    "Don't forget they've all been strengthened with gene therapy. They carry genes which make them excellent soldiers. Don't get careless just because they don't have much experience.",
    "She said that she had just joined up as a new recruit. She said they threw her in prison because she refused to take part in the rebellion. I gave her the key. Looks like she managed to break out of here though. I hope she's okay.",
    "The amount of spent nuclear fuel and plutonium is increasing even today. Listen, have you ever seen a warehouse full of nuclear material? Drums and drums of nuclear waste stacked this high. As far as you can see because there's still no real way to dispose of the stuff.",
    "Mankind continues to fight, but it is a desperate fight to stay alive. I suppose that he chose a life of warfare since that was the only way he knew. Like you, Father, he chose of a path of destruction... Farewell, land of my birth. Never again will these eyes gaze upon your beauty.",
    "I know why you've come, False Shepherd. I see every sin that blackens your soul. Wounded Knee. The Pinkertons. The drinking and the gambling. And, of course, Anna. And now, to repay a debt, you've come for my lamb. But not all debts can be repaid, Booker.",
    "Look at these, they're amazing! Which one do you like more? This one, or this? The bird is beautiful, and the cage is somber, but there's really something special about it. I just can't decide.",
    "Do you understand the expense people went through to keep you locked up in that tower? You think people like that are just gonna let you walk away? You are an investment and you will not be safe until you are far away from here.",
    "Comstock says all this trouble, all this strife, is on our heads. Says we're to blame. Says ain't nobody got nothing to complain about, and if it's not fine for you and yours, that's 'cause you a backslider and you've fallen into sin.",
    "Come on, let's leave this place. Let's go to the factory and get our airship. This isn't our responsibility - none of it. You just opened a door to this world and we stepped through.",
    "Some men dream of money, some men dream of love. My father dreamt of a flood of fire. We were given Eden, and we turned it into Sodom. Why do we deserve salvation? The Lord gave Noah a fish in the form of a flood. But he was not so easy on me.",
    "The mask salesman said that if you got back the precious thing that was stolen from you, he could return you to normal! Did you completely forget or what?",
    "I bet he was referring to the four areas just outside town. There's one in each compass direction. But what do you suppose he meant by \"the four who are there?\"",
    "Without warning the Halon system goes off. Pillars of high-pressure gas flood into the room, sucking the oxygen out of the air, making it impossible for a fire to breathe. A fire. Or people.",
    "Three shiny steel doors stand at the centre of the hallway. Bodies are everywhere. Killed as they waited for an elevator. The eerie silence is broken by a scratching sound. One of the elevator doors pops open an inch. Hands force their way out.",
    "The hallway is luxurious and tasteful. Tapestries and paintings of old relatives that Alice doesn't recognize adorn the walls. But this isn't a quaint old house. There's something in the air.",
    "I'm telling you that you've got a problem. And you do. Don't give me that stupefied look! It makes you look like you oughta be in diapers! Just listen, OK? I'm here to teach you what I know about this island.",
    "You cannot defeat me with a blade that does not sparkle with the power to repel evil! What you hold is useless. Go back to the world below, and tell that to the pathetic fools who made this blade! Its power is gone, and its edges are dull!",
    "In order to return the power to repel evil to your sword, you must find another to take my stead in this temple and ask the gods for their assistance. You must find the one who carries on my bloodline... The one who holds this sacred instrument.",
    "Once again, it is our job to finish what the flyboys started. We are leaving this ship platoon, and engaging the Covenant on solid ground. When we meet the enemy, we will rip their skulls from their spine, and toss 'em away, laughin'! Am I right, Marines?",
    "The life pods are launching. We should hurry. The Covenant are destroying the life pods. Warning: blast doors closing. We have to use the ship's maintenance access ways. Follow the navpoint, it will lead you to an opening.",
    "I've hacked into the Covenant battle network. They're actually broadcasting tactical data on unencrypted channels. We should show them who they're dealing with. Master Chief, I'm going to use your suit's transcom system to monitor their chatter.",
    "According to the data in their networks the ring has some kind of deep religious significance. If I'm analyzing this correctly they believe that Halo is some kind of weapon - one with vast, unimaginable power.",
    "The machinery in these canyons are Halo's primary firing mechanisms. They consist of three phase pulse generators that amplify Halo's signal and allow it to fire deep into space. The power levels are enormous I can't even begin to calculate the pulse's range.",
    "There's a teleportation grid that runs throughout Halo. That's how the monitor moves about so quickly. I learned how to tap into the grid when I was in the control center. Unfortunately, each jump requires a rather consequential expenditure of energy.",
    "This hole was caused by some kind of explosive. Pretty powerful if it tore through the ship's hull. All I detect down there are pools of coolant. We should continue our search somewhere else.",
    "Scanning... Just dust and echoes. We're all that's left. We did what we had to do - for Earth. An entire Covenant armada obliterated and the Flood. We had no choice. Halo - it's finished.",
    "I'm not exactly the expert on this sort of thing - for that you'll have to check in with Sam Carter when you get to Liberty Island - but remember that there's any number of other ways to open a door, including using explosives or finding a security computer.",
    "You're not a mech, but you're enough of a machine to need repair bots now and then. If you used up some bioelectric energy getting through the dark area, for example, this contraption can charge you back up.",
    "We get some complaints about this swimming obstacle because the water's contaminated. Recruits forget to grab the HazMat suit and end up in my office. Not pretty.",
    "Situational awareness is key, and agents should not only be familiar with the tactical opportunities offered by their immediate environment, but how those opportunities can be exploited to their advantage with the appropriate equipment.",
    "Always remember the four basic tactics to avoid detection: crouch behind concealment, stay behind enemies, move slowly to avoid making noise, and use shadows to conceal yourself. Be alert to every possibility.",
    "Our files show that the Smuggler is whacked-out paranoid. Watch for booby traps. And the latest news: your brother's team hit some resistance, so they're going to be delayed while we bring in chopper support.",
    "They show you stuff in the military. You wanna know the real battlefield, it's microscopic. We can't even see it. Lucky for me, I got immunizations, but that guy... Well, once you're infected, you're infected.",
    "The automobile brake was not invented until 1895. Before this, someone had to remain in the car at all times, driving in circles until passengers returned from their errands.",
    "The scientists were always hanging cores on me to regulate my behavior. I've heard voices all my life. But now I hear the voice of a conscience, and it's terrifying, because for the first time it's my voice.",
    "I'm happy to put this all behind us and get back to work. After all, we've got a lot to do, and only sixty more years to do it. More or less. I don't have the actuarial tables in front of me.",
    "Enjoy this next test. I'm going to go to the surface. It's a beautiful day out. Yesterday I saw a deer. If you solve this next test, maybe I'll let you ride an elevator all the way up to the break room, and I'll tell you about the time I saw a deer again.",
    "I've been trying to get answers from him. Where does he come from? How does he do what he does? But he dodges everything, literally, with this super-speed power. When he moves, Barry, you don't even see him. He comes and goes in the blink of an eye, in a...",
    "No I'm not. I'm not the best version of me. I love being The Flash. I love everything about it. The feeling of running hundreds of miles per hour, wind and power just rushing past my face, being able to help people. I'm not sure I can live without it, Caitlin.",
    "Yeah. Well, if the Flash were my son, I'd tell him a few things. First off, I'd tell him it's a dangerous world, so be careful. Then I'd tell him he's a hero, and he's saving a lot of lives. But the most important thing for him to know, I feel, is that his father's proud of him.",
    "I'm a cop - I'm good at reading people - so I know I can trust you with my suspicion. When I go talk to the family and friends of a murder suspect, somebody I know is guilty, and I tell them the person they love is a killer, guess what they all say? \"That's not the person I know.\"",
    "You know, Einstein was not only brilliant, he had a great sense of humor. How did it go? \"Any man who drives safely while kissing a pretty girl is not giving the pretty girl the attention she deserves.\" If I learned anything this past year, life's too short not to live.",
    "Barry, time is an extremely fragile construct. Any deviation, no matter how small, could result in a cataclysm. Now here's what you're going to do: Everything you did before, every word you uttered, every step you took, you're going to do again. And you're not going to tell anyone this happened.",
    "Just observation and deduction. I see a propensity for obesity, poverty, a yen for fairy tales. Folks putting what few bucks they do have into a little wicker basket being passed around. I think it's safe to say nobody here's gonna be splitting the atom, Marty.",
    "Excuse me. You have one of the largest auras I've ever seen. Green and black. It's been taking up this whole room. I just... I had to say something. You must have had hundreds of lives.",
    "Well, by the second morning I was out of food. The third day the light bulb burnt out. Pitch black in there. That's when the rats started coming out. I dozed off and I felt a thing nibbling my finger. I woke up, it was, you know, chewing my finger.",
    "By love you mean big lightning bolts to the heart, where you can't eat and you can't work, and you just run off and get married and make babies. The reason you haven't felt it is because it doesn't exist. What you call love was invented by guys like me.",
    "You're born alone and you die alone, and this world just drops a bunch of rules on top of you to make you forget those facts. But I never forget. I'm living like there's no tomorrow, 'cause there isn't one.",
    "Advertising is based on one thing: happiness. And you know what happiness is? Happiness is the smell of a new car. It's freedom from fear. It's a billboard on the side of the road that screams reassurance that whatever you are doing is okay. You are okay.",
    "You know what? I am very comfortable with my mind - thoughts clean and unclean, loving and... the opposite of that. But I am not a woman, and I think it behooves any man to toss all female troubles into the hands of a stranger.",
    "No, you're not. You don't know how to drink. Your whole generation, you drink for the wrong reasons. My generation, we drink because it's good, because it feels better than unbuttoning your collar, because we deserve it. We drink because it's what men do.",
    "I want you to be very clear about this: You were fired. I wanted you out, Cooper wanted you out, and you would be if it weren't for this man. He thought you deserved another chance. That's right, he fought for you.",
    "And let's also say that change is neither good nor bad - it simply is. It can be greeted with terror or joy; a tantrum that says \"I want it the way it was,\" or a dance that says \"Look, something new.\"",
    "No. Because there are people out there who buy things, people like you and me. And something happened, something terrible, and the way that they saw themselves is gone. And nobody understands that. But you do. And that's very valuable.",
    "So I'd say Laura was the worst roommate. She had a nervous breakdown. One morning she's reading the Bible instead of her psych book. The next morning she woke me up, leaning over me with this crazy smile, and said, \"Morning, Stephanie. Have you heard the good news?\"",
    "I don't know what it is about you, but I feel like myself when I'm with you, but the way I always wanted to feel, because I'm in love with you Megan, and I think I have been for a while.",
    "I want you to know that the day you saw something in me, my whole life changed. And since then, it's been my privilege to not only be at your side, but to be treated like a protege. And for you to be my mentor, and my champion.",
    "I refuse to be a failure. I don't care what you want anymore. This is how it's going to work: You will be here only when I tell you you can be here. I'm drawing a 50-mile radius around this house, and if you so much as open your fly to urinate I will destroy you. Do you understand?",
    "I broke a sacred oath and stabbed my king in the back. I killed my own cousin. When the gods judged my brother guilty, I helped him escape that justice. What atonement do I deserve?",
    "I am not a torturer, though it so often is what people deserve. And it does provide answers, but they're usually the wrong answers. My job is to find the right answers. Do you know how I do that? I do it by making people happy. I'd like to make you happy, Vala. That's your name isn't it? Vala?",
    "Children are blameless. I have never hurt them. Your boy is in no immediate danger, this I swear to you. But between us, dear, you did conspire to kill the Queen's soldiers. We both know the penalty for that crime. How will poor Dhom get on without his mother? And with his breathing problem?",
    "I'll talk about whomever I want. She loved her children - I suppose all mothers do. Catelyn and Cersei, it's a fierceness you don't often see. They'd do anything to protect their babies: start a war, burn cities to ash, free their worst enemies. The things we do for love.",
    "Once before, I offered you peace. If you had not been so arrogant, you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships. Instead, you will flee Slaver's Bay on foot, like the Beggar Queen you are.",
    "He had a few accomplices, none on record, most of the time choosing to work alone, keeping the number of people that could turn on him to near zero. It is estimated that he forged over $10.3 billion of priceless antiquities. Never the wiser, the FBI pursued him for six years and finally caught him.",
    "Others say, \"Dress for the job you want.\" I say dress like the man you wanna be. Nick, we have an obligation to assault the commonplace every chance we get, from the clothes we wear, to the art we collect, to the women in our lives.",
    "Neal, the board is deciding whether to release you from your anklet permanently. They wanna know who's in your life. Are they a good influence, or are they gonna steer you back to the dark side?",
    "You once told me you never lied to me and you never will. So I need to know something: The first time Kramer and I went after you for the Degas, how did you switch the paintings?",
    "I'm happy here. You know, someone once told me my life is a dream with an anklet attached. If I wake up tomorrow and that anklet is still on, I have a good job, a wonderful home, a partner and a best friend. A family. But to wake up and answer only to myself, that would mean everything.",
    "Well, that's the heart of our problem isn't it? You don't trust me. You still don't trust me. I may be a ward of the state, and I will do my job for the FBI, but as far as my personal life goes, we are done. We're done.",
    "You asked me why I don't have original art? I've had three different names and a dozen different aliases because of you. And to be an artist, you have to know who you are.",
    "First time we had dinner, you asked me what I wanted from you. And the first time we kissed, I realized that I don't want anything... except you. And now I'm asking if you'll go on one more adventure with me. Sara Ellis, will you marry me?",
    "This is the most stupid, irresponsible, dangerous thing you have ever done! Is this what you want? Will we have to identify your charred little bodies through their dental records? I want a straight answer! Who did this?",
    "Look at that sky, Malcolm. Just think. Somewhere out there, all those stars and planets, there might be at this very moment a space dad who just got kicked out of his space trailer who's looking down on us. Or would it be up at us? Or maybe sideways?",
    "It's an 8-inch scratch on the car, Francis. Do you know how much it's gonna cost to fix? If you think you are ever, ever borrowing my car again, you are sadly mistaken. And I saw that tattoo, Jimmy. I'm telling your mother.",
    "Crying wolf? You listen to me, you idiot! My child is sick. He does not need you marching in here, puffing up your little chest, and making his life more miserable than it already is. Why don't you just go play \"army man\" somewhere else?",
    "You know what nobody's mentioned? Is that this is supposed to be the greatest army in the world, and you couldn't even kill the three of us. I gotta tell ya, I'm not impressed.",
    "Mom, please let me come home! I'm cold and I'm hungry! Please! I'll fix the roof, I'll paint the house! I'll do anything, Mom, please! Just let me live indoors, Mom! Please! I wanna be warm again! MOM, PLEASE!",
    "I got my hands on some canned fruit, I traded those for batteries, the batteries for DVDs, and I swapped those with the janitor for the school's entire supply of toilet paper. Once the \"specially seasoned\" meatloaf works its magic, I can name my price.",
    "I have been taking care of it! I already got Big Red to cut me the lumber in exchange for a pair of fur-lined boots. I got my friend Pete to make the boots, but only because I promised him a new set of teeth. And as you probably know, teeth don't come cheap! Now, that's where you come in.",
    "I'm not leaving. You guys just chase us out whenever you want without even asking us. I'm getting tired of it! Watching TV is the only thing to do in this house that's actually fun. So you're left with two choices: you can either fight somewhere else, or get us a TV for our room.",
    "Doesn't matter what he says. It's 4:07, and if you don't let me see my client, anything he says after this second will be inadmissible, and I will rain down Fourth Amendment claims on you for the rest of your goddamn life.",
    "With all due respect ma'am, I'm done wasting my breath on you, because the purpose of this hearing was to determine if Mike Ross had reformed. But you don't seem to be interested in that because you've already made your mind up.",
    "It's true, Mr. Ross entered into an early release agreement. But it's also true that he stayed in longer than he had to to keep his cell mate safe. And while he was there, he risked his own life to prevent a violent man from falsely obtaining parole.",
    "You shared something horrible with me, gave me no time to process it, and while I was taking it in you not only attacked my integrity, you made me feel ashamed of myself.",
    "That's great Rachel, but I'm on my third glass of chardonnay and I don't think you called me over here to tell me you submitted your application to the bar, or that you're putting your foot down with Louis.",
    "What I think is if you can't figure out how to have a simple date with a woman who's already agreed to go out with you, then maybe you don't deserve to go out with her in the first place. How's that for advice?",
    "I just watched the man that I love go to prison so that none of you have to, and it hasn't been five minutes and you're already ripping each other apart.",
    "Let me finish. I thought I wanted to be alone tonight, and then I realized that I didn't because I wanted to be with my family. If you can't keep it together tonight of all nights, then as far as I'm concerned you can all rot in hell.",
    "That woman has to show you're a fraud, but as far as the world knows you're a goddamn lawyer and that's the way it's gonna stay. Don't forget, we don't need to prove you're a lawyer; she needs to prove you're not.",
    "See, that's the kind of thing I'm hoping to avoid. So when my little girl comes down the stairs, you're gonna say how nice it was to meet me, then you're gonna go drop her off at school and you're gonna say goodbye.",
    "Bobby, my uncle loves you. He needs you. So you're gonna get up tomorrow morning and you're gonna get dressed, and you're gonna get in that car and you're gonna do what needs to be done, aren't you?",
    "Here's what's problematic: You don't even know where your boyfriend is half the time, so how do you know if he's in trouble or not? He's into heroin, organized crime, he's associating with some very dangerous people, not to mention Tony Soprano himself.",
    "Aight, look, I know you're not earning what you expected and you got the twins and Nancy. You're a capable guy - your mother let it slip one time, you got an IQ of 158.",
    "It's amazing. You want me to be honest? The favoritism Tony still shows for our cousin after what he's done? What does Tony B. have on this guy? And I'm supposed to maybe take a bullet for this skeeve.",
    "I think that those two people want to be together. I think that love, at the end of the day, is stronger than some mistake somebody made; something they did that they regret. I think that love allows for forgiveness.",
    "I don't do lost causes or tilt at windmills. I don't perform miracles or do the impossible. I make cold calculations about difficult situations, and I do not take on anything I know I won't win. And I will win this - I just need you to trust me. I promise you, I will not let you die in here.",
    "Olivia Pope doesn't use her magic for evil, she uses it for good. Olivia Pope doesn't move Heaven and Earth and further corrupt the justice system unless she knows at the end of the day she can put on the white hat and ride out of town.",
    "Like you said, I am a terrifying political animal. So I want to be clear: I will not attend any more of those meetings again. If any of this comes up, I will deny, deny, deny. And if anyone ever asks me about Defiance...",
    "You can tie up a lot of resources by keeping a bugged phone line open. As long as it's open, they're supposed to keep listening. Say a few cryptic things now and then and they'll be stuck in their little van trying to figure out what the hell you're doing.",
    "In any new job there's always friction with your coworkers. They're wondering if the boss likes the new guy better, if he's going to make them look bad. In some jobs, that can get you a dark look in the break room; in other jobs, that can get you a bullet in the back of the head.",
    "A basic rule of covert ops is let someone else do your dirty work. Let someone else find the guy you want to kill. It's a great technique... as long as you're not the someone else.",
    "When you work as a spy, it's easy to think of people as assets - resources to accomplish a goal - because you don't have a personal relationship with an asset. You don't care about an asset. You don't miss the scent of an asset when she leaves the room.",
    "When you're being followed by the police, it's important to remember that having cops around is a problem for criminals, but it's an even bigger problem for a detective trying to remain inconspicuous on a stakeout.",
    "These questions of good and evil, as important as they are, have no place in a court of law. Only the facts matter. My client claims he acted in self-defense.",
    "People always ask me how can we charge so much for what amounts to gradations of white. I tell them it's not about the artist's name or the skill required, not even about the art itself. All that matters is \"How does it make you feel?\"",
    "That's what makes you dangerous. It's not the mask, it's not the skills, it's your ideology. The lone man who thinks he can make a difference. I'm glad we could talk. I... I respect your conviction even if it runs counter with my own.",
    "But he didn't and he never will. We all pay for our choices kid. Maybe your old man fought for you, maybe he did it for himself. The only thing you know for sure is he's gone now. But I'm here. Now, get up. Time to stop taking a beating and start giving one.",
    "I'm not very good at this, out, being in public. But I felt the need to speak up for this city that I love with all my heart. No one should have to live in fear, in fear of madmen who have no regard for who they injure.",
    "Few things are absolute, Matthew. Even Lucifer was once an angel. It's why judgment and vengeance are best left to God, especially when murder is not in your heart.",
    "Nothing drives people to the church faster than the thought of the Devil snapping at their heels. Maybe that was God's plan all along, why He created him, allowed him to fall from grace - to become a symbol to be feared, a warning to us all to tread the path of the righteous.",
    "I've been quite open about this around the office: I don't want this parks department to build any parks, because I don't believe in government. I think that all government is a waste of taxpayer money. My dream is to have the park system privatized and run entirely for profit by corporations.",
    "When you're in government, there's a million ways to exploit your power. Have I ever given in to that temptation? No. Never. I'm not that kind of politician.",

    "I would like to be President someday, so no, I have not smoked marijuana. I ate a brownie once at a party in college. It was intense. It was kind of indescribable actually. I felt like I was floating. Turns out there wasn't any pot in the brownie, it was just an insanely good brownie.",
    "But then he'll wonder why I haven't been married. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna say that I was married. The real question is should I say that I have kids? Guys like girls that have kids right?",
    "What if he shows up with another woman? What if one of my sleeves catches on fire and it spreads rapidly? What if instead of tic tacs I accidentally pop a couple of Ambien and I have to keep punching my leg to stay awake?",
    "He was eating a peach when I went to go talk to him! This is his ace of spades! This is his calling card! This is what he leaves all his victims. And it's still warm. Okay go and arrest him and send this to the lab!",
    "Les, there are two kinds of women in this world: there are women who work hard and stress out about doing the right thing, and then there are women who are cool. You could either be a Cleopatra, or you could be an Eleanor Roosevelt. I'd rather be Cleopatra.",
    "The fourth floor is awful! The DMV, Divorce Filings, Probation Offices, ugh. They put a popcorn machine up there just to brighten things up, but they used the wrong kind of oil and a bunch of people had to get their throats replaced.",
    "Leslie needs to butt out. The whole point of this country is if you want to eat garbage, balloon up to 600 pounds, and die of a heart attack at 43, you can. You are free to do so. To me, that's beautiful.",
    "I am only here because I owe Leslie a thousand favors. I'm not big on charities. Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day, don't teach a man to fish and you feed yourself. He's a grown man - fishing is not that hard.",
    "I take care of my body above all else. Diet, exercise, supplements, positive thinking. Scientists believe that the first human being who will live 150 years has already been born. I believe I am that human being.",
    "Just give me all the bacon and eggs you have. Wait, wait, I'm worried what you just heard was \"Give me a lot of bacon and eggs.\" What I said was \"Give me all the bacon and eggs you have.\" Do you understand?",
    "Okay, I don't know you, but I do know that you can fix your attitude. Do you wanna go home and feel sorry for yourself about a man you didn't wanna marry? Or do you wanna go talk to that cute boy who's been looking at you and give him your number before I throw him in my Benz for myself?",
    "My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window, and I can't see at all. And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall. It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad.",
    "But you'd have to walk a thousand miles in my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me. I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain, you feel mine. Go inside each other's minds, just to see what we find, look at stuff through each other's eyes.",
    "To my babies: stay strong. Daddy will be home soon. And to the rest of the world, God gave you them shoes that fit you, so put 'em on and wear 'em. Be yourself, man. Be proud of who you are. Even if it sounds corny, never let no one tell you you ain't beautiful.",
    "There's enough to pass around, you don't gotta wait in line. And the clocks don't work, you don't gotta check the time. And the blinds don't work, you don't gotta check the sky. We be going all night, till light.",
    "Talk to me baby. Tell me what you're feeling. You say you don't need to go... don't you pretend you didn't know... how all of this would end up. Girl I saw it in your eyes, and baby I can read your mind, and expectations were not in sight.",
    "And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb. And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come. But at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young. This I know. Yeah, this I know.",
    "I ran out of tears when I was 18, so nobody made me but the main streets. 'Cause too many people think they made me. Well, if they really made me then replace me.",
    "Homeless to Forbes List, these people bring no stress. I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen. And if you ain't my friend then your girl single to me. I don't give a damn if a guy said he knew me.",
    "Apart from the excruciating pain, this is great! I've been waiting for a mighty Vault Hunter to help me reach Sanctuary. I will be your wise leader, and you shall be my fearsome minion!",
    "So can we be friends sweetly before the mystery ends? I love you more than the world can contain in its ramshackle head. There's only a shadow of me; in a manner of speaking I'm dead.",
    "What distinguished Ellington from most of his contemporaries was that he set himself the goal of expanding the time frame of the jazz piece, stretching it well beyond the limits of the 78-rpm side and into the realm of the large-scale classical work.",
    "The first notes on the clarinet are simply a rising scale, but it is split down the middle: the first half belongs to C-sharp major, the second half to G major. This is an unsettling opening, for several reasons.",
    "The first part of the Rite, which ends with the sweat-inducing crescendo of \"Dance of the Earth,\" is viscerally exciting, even celebratory. Part II is grittier, swaying between languor and violence.",

    "The willow it weeps today. A breeze from the distance is calling your name. Unfurl your black wings and wait. Across the horizon it's coming to sweep you away, it's coming to sweep you away. Let the wind carry you home. Blackbird fly away. May you never be broken again.",
    "There were several answers, none of which would help. There was no point in assuring his terrified wife that Joe Van Dorn was the steadiest of men in a gunfight, ever cool, alert, and deadly.",
    "The old sea captain, not surprisingly, was an excellent witness. He had observed closely and recalled details. He estimated that the boat was sixty or seventy feet long.",
    "Seriously, it should have been more dramatic. His brain ought to have been flushing its entire current stock of hypotheses about the universe, none of which allowed this to happen.",
    "All right, if this guy just took advantage of a natural accident to sell me twenty-four cans of nothing, I'm going to applaud his creative entrepreneurial spirit and then kill him.",

    "In the middle of our life journey I found myself in a dark wood. I had wandered from the straight path. It isn't easy to talk about it: it was such a thick, wild, and rough forest that when I think of it my fear returns.",
    "So let me get this straight. Wait, I'm the rookie? But my features and my shows are ten times your pay. 50k for a verse with no album out. Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it.",
    "I cannot get a hold of anything. Even if I frantically extend my hand, when I think I've reached you, you go away. Even if I think I've made it, it'll start all over again. Because of that, nevertheless, I'm happy that you haven't disappeared.",
    "This is a promise with a catch. Only if you're looking can it find you. 'Cause true love is searching too. But how can it recognize you unless you step out into the light? Don't be sad, I know you will be, but don't give up until true love will find you in the end.",
    "My apologies. I have a nephew named Anfernee, and I know how mad he gets when I call him Anthony. Almost as mad as I get when I think about the fact that my sister named him Anfernee.",
    "In and around the lake. Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there. One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you, ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too. Twenty four before my love you'll see, I'll be there with you.",
    "When they came to a space to be bridged by a leap, he would muzzle Gray Wolf and whine, and she would stand with ears alert - listening. Then Kazan would take the leap, and she understood the distance she had to cover. She always over-leaped, which was a good fault.",
    "Years ago my mother used to say to me, \"In this world, Elwood, you must be oh so smart or oh so pleasant.\" Well, for years I was smart. I recommend pleasant.",
    "It's too late to articulate it, that empty feeling. You share the same fate as the people you hate. You build yourself up against others' feelings, and it left you feeling empty as a car coasting downhill. I have become such a negative person.",
    "Last night, I had a dream about you. In this dream I'm dancing right beside you, and it looked like everyone was having fun; the kind of feeling I've waited so long.",
    "October arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle. Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students.",
    "We give it away with nothing left to lose. Got the strongest heart but still the skin can bruise. Only the climb will get you higher, defeat will make a fighter. Stare into the face of the truth.",

    "A little bit of Monica in my life, a little bit of Erica by my side, a little bit of Rita's all I need, a little bit of Tina's what I see, a little bit of Sandra in the sun, a little bit of Mary all night long, a little bit of Jessica here I am, a little bit of you makes me your man.",
    "Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.",
    "If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, they will be practically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be useless.",

    "It's strange, but the way you look right now sort of looks like this tree. It looks all dark and gloomy, almost like it could start crying any second now. How sad...",
    "I must've forgot, you can't trust me. I'm open a moment and closed when you show it. Before you know it, I'm off at sea. And now that I write and think about it, and the story unfolds; you should take my life, you should take my soul.",
    "Oh, you're leaving... I always knew that one day, this day would come. I've always known we're so different, and I'm not sad, because you have a lot ahead of you. I want you to take this. Don't forget me.",

    "You're gentrifying. Soon, the skinny jeans will show up, then the skinny lattes, and then the bankers. And you'll be somewhere else starting the cycle all over again. Maybe you're not a classic garden variety hipster, but you're what the hipsters aspire to be. You, Trevor, are the proto-hipster.",

    "Out on the road today I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac. A little voice inside my head said: \"Don't look back, you can never look back.\" I thought I knew what love was. What did I know? Those days are gone forever. I should just let 'em go.",

    "I'm so happy because today I've found my friends. They're in my head. I'm so ugly, but that's okay, 'cause so are you. We broke our mirrors. Sunday morning is everyday for all I care and I'm not scared. Light my candles in a daze 'cause I've found God.",

    "They're pills that create a sort of temporary forgettingness. So if somebody finds out how you do a trick, you just give 'em one of these, and they forget the whole thing. It's a mainstay of the magician's toolkit, like how clowns always have a rag soaked in ether.",
    "So the speech was disturbing, the food was inedible, and the gift bags pretty frightening. And when Gob found out that he wasn't going to get any tips, the service got worse. Oh and that old racist woman choked on Buster's thumb. All in all it was one of the Bluths' better parties.",
    "Well, you and I have different management styles. I believe work should be fun and you try to crush people's spirits. What's next, Michael? Are you going to make dancing illegal? Is this the tiny town from Footloose?",
    "It's zero hour, Michael. It's the end of the line. I'm the firstborn. Sick of playing second fiddle. Always third in line for everything. Tired of finishing fourth. Being the fifth wheel. There are six things I'm mad about, and I'm taking over.",
    "Soon, George Michael went to Ann's to try to win her back. But her Uncle Paul told him that Ann had moved in with her boyfriend. He also mentioned that we all only had three more weeks on earth, and that fossils were just something the Jews buried in 1924.",

    "What if all of this is a dream, and it isn't even our dream, it's that dog's dream? Maybe we're just existing in his mind and all of a sudden he'll go drink out of the toilet and we'll be gone. What will happen to us if that dog wakes up? It will be over.",

    "Isn't it kind of weird? It's like, there's a guy in a gorilla suit, and there's - he's got a robot head, and inside he's got kind of a bunch of clay... I mean, I've seen Dali paintings that make more sense than this movie does.",
    "And, and maybe the first chair trombone player from the high school band comes by you know, and he takes pity on you, tries to drive you home and all. Oh but no, Mike! You wanna swerve home in your cherried-out Dodge Charger!",

    "I put a lot of thought into the Universe; came up with the rules. It sets a bad example if I break them - not to mention, shows favoritism. Why should one person get a miracle, and not everybody else? Can you imagine the confusion? It's better when we all abide by the rules.",
    "There are many ways to get out; surrender is one, losing is another. Winning, cheating, which I don't recommend, but you have to do something. You have to have a strategy.

    "It's your standard felony complaint 155-34. It ought to get me about 1 to 5. With good behavior I ought to be back on the streets in '77. A little more resentful towards society. With a little less faith in the capacity of human beings to forgive.",
    "It's the weather. When it gets damp and cold people get depressed, irritable and unpleasant. In the winter, Scandinavia has more lunatics per capita than any other country in the world.",

    "When I think of Butts, I imagine the ancients in India deciding that the knight should move two squares over and one up or one up and two over. I think of the Greeks or Egyptians determining what to do when a black backgammon chip landed on a space occupied by a white one.",
    "It's very frustrating to me that we have not yet managed to develop an audience for the game. I don't mean participants. I mean people watching. People could watch Scrabble a lot more often than they would watch chess. Scrabble has more mainstream appeal. It is more easily understood than chess.",
    "Within their world, games afford respect and sustenance and a place to pass the time: outcasts welcome. But much of that world, like the Flea House, is gone, or, like the corporate-run Scrabble clubs and tournaments, bowdlerized.",

    "We lost something the more we specialized - it started to drain away this vast pool of information that everybody knew. Knowledge was what connected us, and now it distinguishes us.",

    "I wonder, how you can expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me? You see, I do not generally permit people to talk when I am talking.",
    "No, I thought not. You have not asked me for instance, what is my favorite jam, to check that I am not an impostor. For future reference, Harry, it is raspberry... although of course, if I were a Death Eater, I would have been sure to find out my own jam preferences before impersonating myself.",

    "Sometimes you remind me a lot of James. He called it my 'furry little problem' in company. Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit.",
    "Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back!",
    "It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well.",
    "Every second he breathed, the smell of the grass, the cool air on his face, was so precious: To think that people had years and years, time to waste, so much time it dragged, and he was clinging to each second.",

    "You are the true master of death, because the true master does not seek to run away from Death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying.",
    "You look in excellent health to me, Potter, so you will excuse me if I don't let you off homework today. I assure you that if you do die, you need not hand it in.",
    "You think the dead we loved ever truly leave us? You think that we don't recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble? Your father is alive in you, Harry, and shows himself plainly when you have need of him.",
    "My own brother, Aberforth, was prosecuted for practicing inappropriate charms on a goat. It was all over the papers, but did Aberforth hide? No, he did not! He held his head high and went about his business as usual! Of course, I'm not entirely sure he can read, so that may not have been bravery.",
    "At last Frodo spoke. 'I do not wish to go,' he said; 'but neither do I wish to refuse the advice of Gandalf. I beg that there should be no vote, until we have slept on it. Gandalf will get votes easier in the light of the morning than in this cold gloom. How the wind howls!'",
    "The world is indeed full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps the greater.",

    "'The counsel of Gandalf was not founded on foreknowledge of safety, for himself or for others,' said Aragorn. 'There are some things that it is better to begin than to refuse, even though the end may be dark.'",
    "It's a pity that folk as talk about fighting the Enemy can't let others do their bit in their own way without interfering. He'd be mighty pleased, if he could see you now. Think he'd got a new friend, he would.",
    "I was talking aloud to myself. A habit of the old: they choose the wisest person present to speak to; the long explanations needed by the young are wearying.",
    "Not so hasty! You call yourselves hobbits? But you should not go telling just anybody. You'll be letting out your own right names if you're not careful.",
    "The Dark Lord has Nine. But we have One, mightier than they: the White Rider. He has passed through the fire and the abyss, and they shall fear him. We will go where he leads.",
    "It is not our part to master all the tides of the world, but to do what is in us for the succour of those years wherein we are set, uprooting the evil in the fields that we know, so that those who live after may have clean earth to till. What weather they shall have is not ours to rule.",

    "Many folk like to know beforehand what is to be set on the table; but those who have laboured to prepare the feast like to keep their secret; for wonder makes the words of praise louder.",
    "There is no real going back. Though I may come to the Shire, it will not seem the same; for I shall not be the same. I am wounded with knife, sting, and tooth, and a long burden. Where shall I find rest?",
    "I tried to save the Shire, and it has been saved, but not for me. It must often be so, Sam, when things are in danger: some one has to give them up, lose them, so that others may keep them. But you are my heir: all that I had and might have had I leave to you.",
    "Well, here at last, dear friends, on the shores of the Sea comes the end of our fellowship in Middle-earth. Go in peace! I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.",
    "'Cause what the world needs now is a new kind of tension 'cause the old one just bores me to death. 'Cause what the world needs now is another folk singer like I need a hole in my head.",
    "I don't know what the world may need but a V-8 engine's a good start for me. I think I'll drive and find a place to be surly. I don't know what the world may want but some words of wisdom could comfort us. Think I'll leave that up to someone wiser.",
    "Everyday I get up and pray to Jah and he increases the number of clocks by exactly one. Everybody's coming home for lunch these days. Last night there were skinheads on my lawn. Take the skinheads bowling, take them bowling.",
    "Some people say that bowling alleys got big lanes. Some people say that bowling alleys all look the same. There's not a line that goes here that rhymes with anything. Had a dream last night but I forget what it was.",
    "And I don't want the world to see me 'cause I don't think that they'd understand. When everything's meant to be broken, I just want you to know who I am.",
    "Well, we like our Internet slow, okay? We can turn it on, walk around, dance, make a sandwich. With DSL, there's no dancing, no walking, and we'd starve. It'd be all work and no play. Have you not seen The Shining, Mom?",
    "The battle for soup versus salad is raging in the other room. Come quick and settle it please, as I am running out of French curse words that they won't understand.",
    "Tradition is a trap that allows people to stick their head in the sand. Everything in the past was so quaint, so charming. Times were simpler, kids didn't have sex, neighbors knew each other. It's a friggin' fairy tale. Things sucked then too, they just sucked without indoor plumbing.",
    "I don't even like kids. They're always sticky like they've got jam on their hands. Even if there's no jam in the house, somehow, they've always got jam on their hands! I'm not the right guy to deal with that. I have no patience for jam hands!",
    "In fact, if you put oy and poodle together in the same sentence, you'd have a great new catch phrase, you know? Like, oy with the poodles already. So from now on, when the perfect circumstances arise, we will use our favorite new catch phrase.",

    "Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I will have a little talk in the kitchen. There's a sentence I never thought I'd say.",
    "You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day? Well, like that - only, instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time and garbage is all that has survived!",
    "Hi, Ben. So you want to be an actor, huh? Well, I got to tell you, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. I mean, one day you're Dr. Drake Ramoray. The next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.",

    "First divorce: wife's hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second divorce: said the wrong name at the altar, kind of my fault. Third divorce: they shouldn't let you get married when you're that drunk and have stuff drawn all over your face, Nevada's fault.",
    "The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.",
    "No, I don't want to debate about it, if you're not over here in twenty minutes with my door I shall come over there and insert a large garden gnome in you. Good day.",
    "Oh, dear, what happened? Did you get entangled in the eiderdown again? Not enough cream in your eclair? Hmmm... or did you have to talk to all your friends for so long that you didn't have time to perm your ears?",
    "I say to man in shop \"Is rat.\" He say \"No, no, no. Is a special kind of hamster. Is filigree Siberian hamster.\" Only one in shop. He make special price: only five pound.",
    "Well, may I ask what you expected to see out of a Torquay hotel bedroom window? Sydney Opera House, perhaps? The Hanging Gardens of Babylon? Herds of wildebeest sweeping majestically...?",
    "Manuel... my wife informs me that you're... depressed. Let me tell you something. Depression is a very bad thing. It's like a virus. If you don't stamp on it, it spreads throughout the mind, and then one day you wake up in the morning and you... you can't face life any more!",
    "Well, that was fun, wasn't it dear, the odd moment like that? It's almost worth staying alive for, isn't it? It's nice to share a moment like that, isn't it, dear? It's what marriage is all about. I know - I read it on the back of a matchbox.",
    "I cheated on the intelligent test, I'm sorry! But you then made the past few weeks great. Me and you were doing stuff together, you've helped me out with things, we're closer than we've ever been. I love you, dad, and I think if something can bring us that close, it can't possibly be bad.",

    "Quit complaining! This way I don't have to waste money on morphine! Well Smithers, you were right, he was not dead. I guess I owe you a Coke after all. And as for you, you clinking, clattering cacophony of collagenous cogs and camshifts, take that!",
    "I been slumping all season but now I found a reason. I struck on a love that is true. I used to play the field, I used to be a roamer, but the season's turning 'round for me now. I finally bagged me a homer. That's right, I finally bagged me a Homer.",
    "I've sold monorails to Brockway, Ogdenville, and North Haverbrook, and by gum, it put them on the map. Well sir, there's nothing on Earth like a genuine, bona fide, electrified six-car monorail. What'd I say?",
    "You're right, Mom. I shouldn't let this bother me. I'm in television now. It's my job to be repetitive. My job. My job. Repetitiveness is my job. I'm gonna go out there and give the best performance of my life!",

    "Oh... and how is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home wine-making course and I forgot how to drive?",
    "Mom, I know your intentions are good but aren't the police the protective force that maintains the status quo for the wealthy elite? Don't you think we ought to attack the roots of social problems instead of jamming people into overcrowded prisons?",
    "Hello, Springfield. Sorry to divert your attention from all the big noises and shiny things. But something's been troubling me lately: television! Wouldn't our lives be so much richer if television were done away with?",
    "Oh, and one more thing; I've stolen a nuclear weapon. And if you do not rid this city of television in two hours, I will detonate it. Farewell. By the way, I'm well aware of the irony of appearing on TV in order to decry it, so don't bother pointing that out.",
    "Yes, the Simpsons have come a long way since an old drunk made humans out of his rabbit characters to pay off his gambling debts. Who knows what adventures they'll have between now and the time the show becomes unprofitable?",
    "The only problem with the treatment was that it worked too well. You became unable to express any anger at all. From that point on, any time you felt angry, you could only respond with a string of nonsensical jabbering.",
    "Hello. I'm Leonard Nimoy. The following tale of alien encounters is true. And by true, I mean false. It's all lies. But they're entertaining lies. And in the end, isn't that the real truth? The answer is no. Now our story begins on a Friday morning in a little town called Springfield...",
    "I'm interested in upgrading my 28.8 kilobaud internet connection to a 1.5 megabit fiber optic T1 line. Will you be able to provide an IP router that's compatible with my token ring ethernet LAN configuration?",
    "I'm saying you're what's wrong with America, Simpson. You coast through life, you do as little as possible and you leach your decent hardworking people like me.",
    "You can't treat the working man this way! One of these days we'll form a union, and get the fair and equitable treatment we deserve! Then we'll go too far, and become corrupt and shiftless, and the Japanese will eat us alive!",
    "He'll tell you that in nature one creature invariably eats another to survive. Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about!",

    "Oh yeah, I know. We're all part-time here. You see that guy over there? Now, he's an actor. The guy on the phone, he's a prize fighter. This lady over here, she's a beautician. The man behind her, he's a writer. Me? I'm a cab driver. I'm the only cab driver in this place.",
    "The ability to witness two men stand toe to toe in the spirit of sportsmanship and pummel each other into insensibility is what separates us from the animals.",
    "Hey, Alex - you know the really great thing about television? If something important happens, anywhere in the world, night or day... you can always change the channel.",
    "I wonder about things, like, if they call an orange an \"orange,\" then why don't we call a banana a \"yellow\" or an apple a \"red?\" Blueberries, I understand. But will someone explain gooseberries to me?",
    "Well, isn't this great, we've all learned something. Tony can't choose who his sister's gonna fall for, Monica can't choose who she's gonna fall for, and I think that I've learned the greatest lesson of all. I love being lifted.",
    "Let's face it, Reiger, crime pays. You know people go around thinking if they do something bad, then something bad has gotta happen to them. Well, I am living proof that that's not true.",
    "Now wait a minute. Just a minute. There's only one thing you need in life to make you happy, and that is friends. That's all you need is friends, and then you'll be happy. So if you have friends, you'll be a happy person. You also need food and clothes.",
    "Yep, half a million people gathered together in peace and harmony, grooving to Joni and The Who. Hey, you know, if I hadn't gone, there would have only been 499,999 people.",
    "I sit at my table and wage war on myself. It seems like it's all, it's all for nothing. I know the barricades and I know the mortar in the wall breaks. I recognize the weapons, I used them well. This is my mistake. Let me make it good. I raised the wall and I will be the one to knock it down.",
    "I've a rich understanding of my finest defenses. I proclaim that claims are left unstated. I demand a rematch. I decree a stalemate. I divine my deeper motives. I recognize the weapons. I've practiced them well; I fitted them myself.",
    "It's amazing what devices you can sympathize, empathize. This is my mistake; let me make it good. I raised the wall and I will be the one to knock it down.",
    "The other night I dreamt of knives, continental drift divide. Mountains sit in a line, Leonard Bernstein, Leonid Brezhnev, Lenny Bruce, and Lester Bangs. Birthday party, cheesecake, jellybean, boom. You symbiotic, patriotic, slam book neck, right? Right.",
    "Let me ask you this: Do you really think the boy'd shout out a thing like that so the whole neighborhood could hear him? I don't think so - he's much too bright for that.",
    "I feel sorry for you. What it must feel like to want to pull the switch! Ever since you walked into this room, you've been acting like a self-appointed public avenger. You want to see this boy die because you personally want it, not because of the facts! You're a sadist!",
    "Nobody has to prove otherwise. The burden of proof is on the prosecution. The defendant doesn't even have to open his mouth. That's in the Constitution.",
    "This is not some apron-wearing mother you're speaking with - I know all about your Valhalla of decadence and I shouldn't have let him go. He's not ready for your world of compromised values and diminished brain cells that you throw away like confetti. Am I speaking to you clearly?",
    "I didn't ask for this role, but I'll play it. Now go do your best. Be bold, and mighty forces will come to your aid. Goethe said that. It's not too late for you to become a person of substance, Russell. Please get my son home safely. You know, I'm glad we spoke.",
    "Music, you know, true music - not just rock 'n' roll - it chooses you. It lives in your car, or alone, listening to your headphones - you know, with the vast, scenic bridges and angelic choirs in your brain. It's a place apart from the vast, benign lap of America.",
    "First it was butter then it was sugar and white flour, bacon, eggs, bologna, rock 'n' roll, motorcycles. Then it was celebrating Christmas on a day in September when you knew it wouldn't be commercialized! What else are you gonna ban?",
    "In Carl Jung's opinion, we all have a sixth sense - intuition. When you meet someone and you suddenly feel like you can't live without them. This could be the memory of a past love from the collective unconscious. Or it could just be hormones.",
    "That's because we're uncool. And while women will always be a problem for us, most of the great art in the world is about that very same problem. Good-looking people don't have any spine. Their art never lasts. They get the girls, but we're smarter.",
    "My name is Harvey Pekar - that's an unusual name - Harvey Pekar. 1960 was the year I got my first apartment and my first phone book. Now imagine my surprise when I looked up my name and saw that in addition to me, another Harvey Pekar was listed.",
    "Yes. I consider myself a nerd. And this movie has uplifted me. There's this one scene, where a nerd grabs the microphone during a pep rally and announces that he is a nerd and that he is proud of it and stands up for the rights of other nerds.",
    "You know, I don't really know what to expect. Sometimes you look like a younger Brando... but then the way Crumb draws you, you look... like a hairy ape, with all these wavy, stinky lines undulating off your body. I don't really know what to expect.",
    "You know, you go to thrift shops and you go to garage sales because you think you're going to find something that's, you know, real rare. And most of the time, it's a total waste of time, but once in a while, you'll, you'll come up with something that'll whet your appetite.",
    "We just don't recognize life's most significant moments while they're happening. Back then I thought, \"Well, there'll be other days.\" I didn't realize that that was the only day.",
    "By the time I was ten, playing baseball got to be like eating vegetables or taking out the garbage. So when I was fourteen, I started to refuse. Could you believe that? An American boy refusing to play catch with his father.",
    "Getting thrown out of baseball was like having part of me amputated. I've heard that old men wake up and scratch itchy legs that been dust for over fifty years. That was me. I'd wake up at night with the smell of the ballpark in my nose, the cool of the grass on my feet... The thrill of the grass.",
    "Then Annie got the crazy idea that she could talk me into buying a farm. I'm thirty-six years old, I love my family, I love baseball, and I'm about to become a farmer. And until I heard the Voice, I'd never done a crazy thing in my whole life.",
    "I never got to bat in the major leagues. I'd have liked to have had that chance just once, to stare down a big league pitcher. To stare him down, then just as he goes into his windup, wink. Make him think you know something he doesn't. That's what I wish for.",
    "I used to love travelling on the trains from town to town. The hotels... brass spittoons in the lobbies, brass beds in the rooms. It was the crowd, rising to their feet when the ball was hit deep. Shoot, I'd play for nothing!",
    "This is my most special place in all the world, Ray. Once a place touches you like this the wind never blows so cold again. You feel for it like it was your child. I can't leave Chisholm.",
    "Man, I did love this game. I'd have played for food money. It was the game... The sounds, the smells. Did you ever hold a ball or a glove to your face?",
    "When my son was born healthy, I never asked why. Why was I so lucky? What did I do to deserve this perfect child, this perfect life? But when he got sick, you can bet I asked why! I demanded to know why! Why was this happening?",
    "Ronald Reagan? The actor? Then who's Vice President? Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wyman is the First Lady! And Jack Benny is Secretary of the Treasury. I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!",
    "You know, Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really made a difference in my life. You've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing that I'm going to be around to see 1985. That I'm gonna succeed in this! That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time!",
    "Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know if you let people walk over you now they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life! Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?",
    "They wanted me to build them a bomb so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shoddy bomb casing full of used pinball machine parts. Come on! Let's get you a radiation suit. We must prepare to reload.",
    "I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!",
    "Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour the instant the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine.",
    "October is inventory time, so right now, Statler Toyota is making the best deals of the year on all 1985-model Toyotas. You won't find a better car at a better price with better service anywhere in Hill Valley. That's Statler Toyota in downtown Hill Valley.",
    "And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.",
    "The way I see it if you're going to build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style? Besides, the stainless steel construction made the flux dispersal - look out!",
    "I don't worry. This is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you it's like I'm kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?",
    "No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.",
    "What do you care what I think anyway? I don't even count, right? I could disappear forever and it wouldn't make any difference. I might as well not even exist at this school, remember?",
    "Well, Mr. Gardner, I must admit that is one of the most refreshing and optimistic statements I've heard in a very, very long time. I admire your good, solid sense. That's precisely what we lack on Capitol Hill.",
    "You know what I'd like to be? A cartoon of some kind. You know, like when they get hit in the head with a frying pan or something, and their head looks like the frying pan, with the handle and everything? Then they just go boing and their head comes back to normal? Wouldn't that be great?",
    "I was proud of my work. And the buildings went up. When they were finished the damnedest thing happened. It was like the buildings were too good for us. Nobody told us that. It just felt uncomfortable, that's all.",
    "These college kids out here - they're never gonna get old or out of shape 'cause new ones come along every year. And they're gonna keep calling us 'Cutters'. To them, it's just a dirty word. To me, it's just somethin' else I never got a chance to be.",
    "Don't you know what it means to me to be a Marine, Dad? Ever since I was a kid I've wanted this - I've wanted to serve my country - and I want to go. I want to go to Vietnam and I'll die there if I have to.",
    "They burned the flag and they demonstrated against us; it's on the cover of the paper today. They have no respect. They have no idea what's going on over there, Mom - the men that are sacrificing their lives. People are dying every day over there, and nobody back here even seems to care.",
    "I had a mother, I had a father, things - things that made sense. Do you remember things that made sense? Things you could count on? Before we all got so lost? What are we gonna do, Charlie? What am I gonna do?",
    "It's my leg! I want my leg, you understand? Can't you understand that? All's I'm sayin' is that I want to be treated like a human being! I fought for my country! I am a Vietnam veteran! I fought for my country!",
    "I read this thing the other day about how when you hear that ding on your inbox you get like a dopamine rush in your brain. It's like we're being chemically rewarded for allowing ourselves to be brainwashed. How evil is that?",
    "I find myself so furious at all these people that I am in contact with just for controlling me or whatever but you know they are not even aware they are doing it.",
    "I don't think it really helped me, in my love life, my nascent love life. I think that having won something like that could be regarded as being a significant liability.",
    "We're really seeing a great game here. Uh, it almost - uh, Steve almost lost a man right there at the end of that board. He got a lucky, lucky break. The randomness went the opposite way that it usually goes.",
    "I wanted to be a hero. I wanted to be the center of attention. I wanted the glory. I wanted the fame. I wanted the pretty girls to come up and say, \"Hi, I see that you're good at Centipede.\"",
    "I've always felt there's something inherently psychopathic about joining the army in peacetime. As far as I'm concerned people join the army to find out what it's like to kill someone. I hardly think that's an inclination that should be encouraged in modern society, do you?",
    "He's better at this than I've ever been at anything in my life. He's better at this than you'll ever be at anything. My son has a gift. He has a gift and when you acknowledge that then maybe we will have something to talk about.",
    "He didn't teach you how to win, he taught you how not to lose. That's nothing to be proud of. You're playing not to lose, Josh. You've got to risk losing. You've got to risk everything. You've got to go to the edge of defeat. That's where you want to be, boy - on the edge of defeat.",
    "He's not afraid of losing. He's afraid of losing your love. How many ballplayers grow up afraid of losing their fathers' love every time they come up to the plate?",
    "His chess ideas are like pieces of his body he's reluctant to give up. For instance, he simply can't cope with being told not to bring his queen out too early in the game. Why shouldn't he? He's won many a game in Washington Square doing exactly that, why is this suddenly wrong?",
    "What I'm trying to teach him and what he's learning there are two very different things. Park hustlers play tactics, not position. They rely on wild, unpredictable moves meant to intimidate their opponent. Great in a two-minute speed game for drug money, but it'll cost Josh dearly in real games.",
    "Clear the lines of lint in your head one at a time and the king will be left standing alone like a guy on a street corner. Here, I'll make it easier for you.",
    "You know, you really don't need a forensics team to get to the bottom of this. If you guys were the inventors of Facebook, you'd have invented Facebook.",
    "Ma'am, I know you've done your homework and so you know that money isn't a big part of my life, but at the moment I could buy Mt. Auburn Street, take the Phoenix Club, and turn it into my ping-pong room.",
    "Everybody on campus was using it. \"Facebook me\" was the common expression after two weeks. And Mark was the biggest thing on a campus that included 19 Nobel laureates, 15 Pulitzer Prize winners, 2 future Olympians and a movie star.",
    "I didn't wanna spend my twenties as a professional defendant. Who knew the music industry doesn't have a sense of humor? We tried to sell the company to pay the 35 million they said we owed in royalties, but I guess to them that was a little like selling a stolen car to pay for the stolen gas.",
    "Yes. Everyone at Harvard's inventing something. Harvard undergraduates believe that inventing a job is better than finding a job. So I'll suggest again that the two of you come up with a new new project.",
    "I don't hate anybody. The Winklevii aren't suing me for intellectual property theft. They're suing me because for the first time in their lives things didn't go exactly the way they were supposed to for them.",
    "It didn't stop you from writing it. As if every thought that tumbles through your head was so clever it would be a crime for it not to be shared. The Internet's not written in pencil, Mark, it's written in ink.",
    "Even a few people leaving would reverberate through the entire user base. The users are interconnected; that is the whole point. College kids are online because their friends are online, and if one domino goes, the other dominoes go. Don't you get that?",
    "Jerry, if you think that by threatening me you can get me to be your slave... Well, that's where you're right. But - and I am only saying this because I care - there are a lot of decaffeinated brands on the market today that are just as tasty as the real thing.",
    "To graduate you need my course, dear boy. So it seems I have something to say about what you do and where you go. So from now on you and Mitch are going to spend every waking moment in the lab. You will solve my power problem, and you will solve it by my deadline.",
    "It's a praying mantis. Do you know how they mate? The male will sneak up on the female and she'll bite off his head and the rest of his body will keep on mating and when they're done she'll eat him. She'll eat the rest of him.",
    "You know, at one time I used to break into pet shops to liberate the canaries. But I decided that was an idea way before its time. Zoos are full, prisons are overflowing... oh my, how the world still dearly loves a cage.",
    "Well, if some people get upset because they feel they have a hold on some things, I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder: here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to things now. With that in mind, I'm not against collecting stuff.",
    "Look at it. Oh, it's suffocating. Well, it's the smog. You know, people can live with it, but trees - it gives them asthma. They can't breathe. The leaves, look, they're turning all brown. Harold, we have got to do something about this life.",
    "This is pitiful. A thousand people freezing their butts off waiting to worship a rat. What a hype. Groundhog Day used to mean something in this town. They used to pull the hog out, and they used to eat it. You're hypocrites, all of you!",
    "Come on, all the long distance lines are down? What about the satellite? Is it snowing in space? Don't you have some kind of a line that you keep open for emergencies or for celebrities? I'm both. I'm a celebrity in an emergency.",
    "There is no way that this winter is ever going to end as long as this groundhog keeps seeing his shadow. I don't see any other way out. He's got to be stopped. And I have to stop him.",
    "It's the same thing your whole life: \"Clean up your room. Stand up straight. Pick up your feet. Take it like a man. Be nice to your sister. Don't mix beer and wine, ever.\" Oh yeah: \"Don't drive on the railroad track.\"",

    "I think people place too much emphasis on their careers. I wish we could all live in the mountains at high altitude. That's where I see myself in five years. How about you?",
    "I do not for one think that the problem was that the band was down. I think that the problem may have been that there was a Stonehenge monument on the stage that was in danger of being crushed by a dwarf. All right? That tended to understate the hugeness of the object.",
    "We're very lucky in the band in that we have two visionaries, David and Nigel. They're like poets, like Shelley and Byron. They're two distinct types of visionaries. It's like fire and ice basically. I feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that, kind of like lukewarm water.",

    "It just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Mostly dead is slightly alive. With all dead, well, with all dead there's usually only one thing you can do. Go through his clothes and look for loose change.",
    "You truly love each other and so you might have been truly happy. Not one couple in a century has that chance, no matter what the storybooks say. And so I think no man in a century will suffer as greatly as you will.",
    "Do you know what that sound is, Highness? Those are the shrieking eels! If you don't believe me just wait. They always grow louder when they're about to feed on human flesh! If you swim back now I promise no harm will come to you... I doubt you'll get such an offer from the eels.",
    "It's possible, Pig, I might be bluffing. It's conceivable, you miserable, vomitous mass, that I'm only lying here because I lack the strength to stand. But, then again perhaps I have the strength after all. Drop your sword!",
    "I was eleven years old and when I was strong enough I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet I will not fail. I will go up to the six-fingered man and say, \"Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\"",

    "You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas!",
    "Where's that money, you silly stupid old fool? Where's that money? Do you realize what this means? It means bankruptcy and scandal and prison! That's what it means! One of us is going to jail; well, it's not gonna be me!",
    "Your political future? Why, I bought it for you. I gave it to you as a present and I can grab it back so fast it'll make your head swim! You've got a nerve to sit there and worry about your political future when we're in a spot like this!",

    "Dan, let me tell you something. In this envelope are all the questions that James Snodgrass was asked on Twenty One. The odd thing about this envelope is that he appeared on the show January 13th, if you recall. Yet, he somehow mailed this to himself on January 11th via registered mail.",
    "Mr. Van Doren, I'm also from New York, a different part of New York. I'm happy that you made the statement but I cannot agree with most of my colleagues. You see, I don't think an adult of your intelligence ought to be commended for simply, at long last, telling the truth.",
    "He told me this whole story about when a Jew is on the show he always loses to a Gentile and then the Gentile wins more money. I mean who could dream up a scheme like that?",

    "My life, when it is written, will read better than it lived. Henry Fitz-Empress, first Plantagenet, a king at twenty-one, the ablest soldier of an able time. He led men well, he cared for justice when he could and ruled for thirty years a state as great as Charlemagne's.",

    "Let me tell you the story of right hand, left hand. It's a tale of good and evil. Hate: it was with this hand that Cain iced his brother. Love: these five fingers, they go straight to the soul of man. The right hand: the hand of love. The story of life is this: static.",

    "You're right Will. I can't do this proof. But you can and when it comes to that it's only about... it's just a handful of people in the world who can tell the difference between you and me. But I'm one of them.",
    "I'd ask you about love, you'd probably quote me a sonnet. But you've never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable. Known someone that could level you with her eyes, feeling like God put an angel on earth just for you.",
    "You're not perfect, sport, and let me save you the suspense: this girl you've met, she's not perfect either. But the question is whether or not you're perfect for each other.",
    "I mean I look at a piano, I see a bunch of keys, three pedals, and a box of wood. But Beethoven, Mozart, they saw it, they could just play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway, and I can't play the piano.",

    "We think it is time that you recognized that you are masters in someone else's home. Despite the best intentions of the best of you, you must, in the nature of things, humiliate us to control us. General Dyer is but an extreme example of the principle... it is time you left.",

    "Almira Gulch, just because you own half the county doesn't mean that you have the power to run the rest of us. For twenty-three years, I've been dying to tell you what I thought of you! And now... well, being a Christian woman, I can't say it!",
    "A place where there isn't any trouble. Do you suppose there is such a place, Toto? There must be. It's not a place you can get to by a boat or a train. It's far, far away. Behind the moon, beyond the rain...",
    "No! Fool that I am! I should have remembered! Those slippers will never come off as long as you're alive. But that's not what's worrying me. It's how to do it. These things must be done delicately or you hurt the spell.",
    "Why, if I had a brain I could... I could while away the hours, conferrin' with the flowers, consultin' with the rain. And my head I'd be scratchin' while my thoughts were busy hatchin' if I only had a brain.",

    "As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart. You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable.",
    "Very well - I'll bide my time. And as for you, my fine lady, it's true I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like, but just try to stay out of my way - just try! I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog too!",
    "Why, if I had half a chance, I could make an entire movie using this stock footage. The story opens on these mysterious explosions. Nobody knows what's causing them, but it's upsetting all the buffalo. So, the military are called in to solve the mystery.",
    "Finally the press is interested again in Bela Lugosi. There is no such thing as bad press, Eddie. Man from New York even said he was going to put me on the front page - first celebrity ever to check into rehab.",

    "This little droid. I think he's searching for his former master. I've never seen such devotion in a droid before. Ah, he claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know what he's talking about?",

    "To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.",
    "I feel his presence. But he can also feel mine. He's come for me. He can feel it when I'm near. That's why I have to go. As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission. I have to face him.",
    "I have no idea to this day what those two Italian ladies were singing about. Truth is, I don't want to know. Some things are best left unsaid. I'd like to think they were singing about something so beautiful, it can't be expressed in words, and makes your heart ache because of it.",
    "We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders and felt like free men. Hell, we could have been tarring the roof of one of our own houses. We were the lords of all creation.

    "Bad luck, I guess. It floats around. It's got to land on somebody. It was my turn, that's all. I was in the path of the tornado. I just didn't expect the storm would last as long as it has.",
    "Well, the real reason that you've been sent over here is because they wanted you to be evaluated... to determine whether or not you are mentally ill. This is the real reason. Why do you think they might think that?",
    "Well, gentlemen, in my opinion, if we send him back to Pendleton or we send him up to Disturbed, it's just one more way of passing on our problems to somebody else. You know we don't like to do that, so I'd like to keep him on the ward. I think we can help him.",
    "Mac, they said you escaped. I knew you wouldn't leave without me. I was waiting for you. Now we can make it, Mac. I feel big as a damn mountain. Oh, no. I'm not goin' without you, Mac. I wouldn't leave you this way. You're coming with me. Let's go.",

    "Don't you ever talk that way to me. Never! Never! What we've got here is failure to communicate. Some men you just can't reach. So you get what we had here last week - which is the way he wants it. Well, he gets it. I don't like it any more than you men.",
    "He ain't in the box because of the joke played on him. He back-sassed a free man. They got their rules. We ain't got nothin' to do with that. Would probably have happened to him sooner or later anyway, a complainer like him. He gotta learn the rules the same as anybody else.",
    "John-boy, lemme tell you something. You know, them chains ain't medals. You get 'em for making mistakes. And you make a bad enough mistake, and then you gotta deal with the Man. And he is one rough old boy.",
    "You run one time, you got yourself a set of chains. You run twice you got yourself two sets. You ain't gonna need no third set, 'cause you gonna get your mind right.",

    "You're in charge of the last of the Truffula Seeds. And Truffula Trees are what everyone needs. Plant a new Truffula. Treat it with care. Give it clean water. And feed it fresh air. Grow a forest. Protect it from axes that hack. Then the Lorax and all of his friends may come back.",
    "We have advantages. We have a cushion to fall back on. This is abundance. A luxury of place and time. Something rare and wonderful. It's almost historically unprecedented. We must do extraordinary things. We have to. It would be absurd not to.",
    "We are the bright new stars born of a screaming black hole, the nascent suns burst from the darkness, from the grasping void of space that folds and swallows - a darkness that would devour anyone not as strong as we. We are oddities, sideshows, talk show subjects. We capture everyone's imagination.",
    "If we were left solely to the wordy wit of legislators in Congress for our guidance, uncorrected by the seasonable experience and the effectual complaints of the people, America would not long retain her rank among the nations.",
    "Do not trouble yourself much to get new things, whether clothes or friends. Turn the old; return to them. Things do not change; we change. Sell your clothes and keep your thoughts.",
    "I find it wholesome to be alone the greater part of the time. To be in company, even with the best, is soon wearisome and dissipating. I love to be alone. I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude.",
    "I learned this, at least, by my experiment: that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.",
    "Society is commonly too cheap. We meet at very short intervals, not having had time to acquire any new value for each other. We meet at meals three times a day, and give each other a new taste of that old musty cheese that we are.",
    "Consciousness, complex and subtle, can be impaired or ended by a mere stepping-up or dimming-down of any one sense intensity, which is the procedure in hypnosis. And the intensification of one sense by a new medium can hypnotize an entire community.",
    "Language does for intelligence what the wheel does for the feet and the body. It enables them to move from thing to thing with greater ease and speed and ever less involvement.",
    "Until writing was invented, man lived in an acoustic space: boundless, directionless, horizonless, in the dark of the mind, in the world of emotion, by primordial intuition, by terror. Speech is a social chart of this bog.",
    "For I am a sinner in the hands of an angry God. Bloody Mary full of vodka, blessed are you among cocktails. Pray for me now and at the hour of my death, which I hope is soon. Amen.",

    "No one would ever say, \"Come and join us, Caroline,\" so I would then spend the rest of the lunch period feeling sorry for myself and trying to remember that the lonely children like me are the ones who grow up to be someone that everyone wishes they could be.",
    "I didn't know it would be people you barely knew becoming friends that harbored you. And dreams you didn't even know you had - coming true. I didn't know it would be superpowers rising up out of tragedies, and perfect moments in a nearly empty classroom.",

    "I don't know what is going to happen next year, no one does. But that's OK. I can handle it, I decide. It's just a harder gear, and I am ready. All I have to do is take a deep breath and ride.",
    "I wrote about how last weekend my parents and I waited in line at the movies for an hour, and when we finally got up to the ticket booth lady, they were sold out! Isn't that sad?",
    "Music and books stir up emotions. They make feelings rise and clatter and wreck, and sometimes that's dangerous. But music can make you rise up and clatter and destroy when you need to, too.",
    "Love is corny, when you get right down to it. It has two left feet. It trips over itself, because it is so large that it's awkward. It's sort of silly, done right. After all, how do you convey something that huge?",
    "This is the problem with danger, isn't it? You can even be warned and ignore the warning. Danger can seem far away until the sky grows dark, and a bolt of fury heads straight toward you.",
    "When I first learned the truth, I thought Sebastian's life would be ruined. But seeing you, I realized everything would be fine. Because someone still loved him.",
    "I only know that learning to believe in the power of my own words has been the most freeing experience of my life. It has brought me the most light. And isn't that what a poem is? A lantern glowing in the dark.",
    "Late into the night I write and the pages of my notebook swell from all the words I've pressed onto them. It almost feels like the more I bruise the page the quicker something inside me heals.",
    "Maybe, the only thing that has to make sense about being somebody's friend is that you help them be their best self on any given day. That you give them a home when they don't want to be in their own.",
    "Sometimes someone says something and their words are like the catch of a gas stove, the click, click while you're waiting for it to light up and flame big and blue...",
    "This was supposed to be a question. Not a poem, confession or whatever it's become. I just want to know if you would listen with me to the sound of our heartbeats.",
    "She knew since she was little, the world would not sing her triumphs, but she took all of the stereotypes and put them in a chokehold until they breathed out the truth.",
    "There is freedom in coming and going for no other reason than because you can. There is freedom in choosing to sit and be still when everything is always telling you to move, move fast.",
    "It feels scary to talk, because once the words are out, you can't put them back in. But if you write words and they don't come out the way you want them to, you can erase them and start over.",
    "Kazi tells me stories about you once in a while. I hardly ask him to tell me about you, though, because I'm afraid that the stories might run out. I want to save them, like a treat.",
    "I don't ask many questions, so it would be fairer if he answered the few I ask. He should be more appreciative. I could be like Amil and ask a question every five seconds, but he doesn't answer many of those either.",
    "How lovely would it feel to sing like that, to change the air with my voice, to fill people's ears with such pleasure. The sound cleared its own space and made it seem like everything was okay again.",
    "What is going to happen to Kazi, Mama? He's the only one who looks at me with happy, loving eyes. No one else looks at me that way, not even Papa. When Papa looks at us, his eyes are always looking back inside his head at his own thoughts. He sees and he doesn't see.",
    "Everyone is to blame. He says that when you separate people into groups, they start to believe that one group is better than another. I think about Papa's medical books and how we all have the same blood, and organs, and bones inside us, no matter what religion we're supposed to be.",
    "Secretly, I want the box more than the jewelry. I want it to be all mine and never have to give it back. I could find any old thing. A pebble, a leaf, a pistachio shell and put it in the box. Like magic, these things would get to be special at least for a day.",
    "It's better to read in the library. Sitting at my favorite table by the window reading and listening to the sound of other folks turning pages makes me feel like I'm in a house full of company I don't have to talk to.",
    "Say what you will. But a person just cannot know what he doesn't know. And you can't always see that a bad thing is going to happen before it happens. If you could, no bad would ever come.",
    "Got me thinking. I know what I love too. Family and friends. All the ones here and all ones gone. I love my dog, and this orchard, and a crumbledown house.",
    "As it fades, I see the truth - in plain sight, yet hidden all along. We are all children of blood and bone. All instruments of vengeance and virtue. This truth holds me close, rocking me like a child in a mother's arms. It binds me in its love as death swallows me in its grasp.",
    "As long as we don't have magic, they will never treat us with respect. They need to know we can hit them back. If they burn our homes, we burn theirs, too.",
    "Nice things don't happen in storybooks. Or when they do happen, something bad happens next. Because otherwise the story would be boring, and no one would read it.",
    "Faeries make up for their inability to lie with a panoply of deceptions and cruelties. Twisted words, pranks, omissions, riddles, scandals, not to mention their revenges upon one another for ancient, half-remembered slights. Storms are less fickle than they are, seas less capricious.",
    "Cardan's gaze catches mine, and I can't help the evil smile that pulls up the corners of my mouth. His eyes are bright as coals, his hatred a living thing, shimmering in the air between us like the air above black rocks on a blazing summer day.",
    "I consider all the things I have done to become a worthy adversary of him, but maybe I haven't been fighting Cardan at all. Maybe I've been fighting my own shadow.",
    "Nicasia's wrong about me. I don't desire to do as well in the tournament as one of the fey. I want to win. I do not yearn to be their equal. In my heart, I yearn to best them.",
    "\"Have I told you how hideous you look tonight?\" Cardan asks, leaning back in the elaborately carved chair, the warmth of his words turning the question into something like a compliment. \"No,\" I say, glad to be annoyed back into the present. \"Tell me.\"",
    "Ms. Laverne said every day we should ask ourselves, 'If the worst thing in the world happened, would I help protect someone else? Would I let myself be a harbor for someone who needs it?' Then she said, 'I want each of you to say to the other: I will harbor you.' I will harbor you.",
    "Almost heaven, West Virginia. Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River. Life is old there, older than the trees. Younger than the mountains blowing like a breeze. Country roads, take me home to the place I belong. West Virginia, mountain mama. Take me home, country roads.",
    "Have you ever been south of Monterey? Barrancas carve the coast line, and the chaparral flows to the sea 'neath waves of golden sunshine. And have you ever been north of Morro Bay? The south coast plows the sea. And the people there are of the breed, they don't need electricity.",
    "When the snow is on our mind, rows and rows and lines and lines. In the haze of your fixation, we all crave for you, we all crave. And you can kill the wildest thing, but when you murder it's a sin. In the midst of your conviction, we all crave for you, we all crave.",
    "As he watches through the door, his smile pulls in more and more. Wicked thoughts shape wicked ways, while we all crave, while we all crave. When the man yells at his son, when he finds the smoking gun. Don't you worry, little one, for we all crave, we all crave.",
    "You say that you're no good for me, 'cause I'm always tugging at your sleeve, and I swear, I hate you when you leave, I like it anyway. My ghost, where'd you go? I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me. My ghost, where'd you go? What happened to the soul you used to be?",
    "And I will say that we should take a day to break away from all the pain our brain has made, the game is not played alone. And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it and keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone.",
    "As you decide, you shall be left as you were before, and neither richer nor wiser, unless the sense of service rendered to a man in mortal distress may be counted as a kind of riches of the soul.",
    "Rise and shine, Mister Freeman. Rise and shine. Not that I wish to imply you have been sleeping on the job. No one is more deserving of a rest, and all the effort in the world would have gone to waste until... well, let's just say your hour has come again.",
    "Humans just lead short, boring, insignificant lives, so they make up stories to feel like they're a part of something bigger. They want to blame all the world's problems on some single enemy they can fight, instead of a complex network of interrelated forces beyond anyone's control.",
    "I hate this town. It's too filled with memories I'd rather forget. I go to school every day, hang out with my friends, and then go home. There's no place I'd rather not go ever again. I wonder if anything will ever change? Will that day ever come?",
    "When Bill Gates got married on Lanai, he rented every helicopter on the Hawaiian islands so that paparazzi couldn't use them to fly over. Although in that case, it was a positive, because now you can imagine that wedding however you want.",
    "I've never taken you for a killer. A bit intense and unpredictable at times, perhaps emotionally unstable occasionally, but I don't think you're the type of person who could simply walk up to another human being, put a gun to his head, and pull the trigger.",
    "I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right, yet to fail nonetheless. Dread it. Run from it. Destiny still arrives. Or should I say, I have.",
    "What you do as soon as you get up can underpin and affect your mood for the entire day. Therefore it is important to approach the day gently, without a sense of worry, tension or rush. Also, you need to start off by making sure your body is happy and comfortable, otherwise feel ill all day.",
    "I could kill you. Snap my fingers, easiest thing in the world. From here on, I want you to know that the only reason you're alive is because I allowed it.",
    "Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you?",
    "Play the victim all you want. But you and me? We know the truth. Dad loved you best. More than Michael. More than me. Then he brought the new baby home and you couldn't handle it. So this is all just one big temper tantrum. Time to grow up.",
    "Family cares about you, not what you can do for them. Family's there through the good, bad, all of it. They got your back, even when it hurts. That's family.",
    "Ambassador Sara Bair knew that when the captain of the Polk had invited her to the bridge to view the skip to the Danavar system, protocol strongly suggested that she turn down the invitation. The captain would be busy, she would be in the way and in any event there was not that much to see.",
    "What difference does it make? Because in the end, when you lose somebody, every candle, every prayer is not going to make up for the fact that the only thing you have left is a hole in your life where that somebody that you cared about used to be.",
    "Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha!",
    "The time has come, to say fair's fair. To pay our rent, now, to pay our share. The time has come, a fact's a fact. It belongs to them, we're gonna give it back. How do we dance when our earth is turning? How do we sleep when our beds are burning?",
    "Buying bread from a man in Brussels. He was six-foot-four and full of muscles. I said, \"do you speak-a my language?\" He just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich.",
    "Take one moment to escape, it will change your mood when you're walking on the moon. Chase your happy place, it will change your groove when you're dancing on the moon. When we dance again, all our trouble seems to fade away. This is how I feel when you take me to some levels that I've never been.",
    "When I was a young man, I had liberty, but I did not see it. I had time, but I did not know it. And I had love, but I did not feel it. Many decades would pass before I understood the meaning of all three. And now, the twilight of my life, this understanding has passed into contentment.",
    "Don't change your name, keep it the same for fear I may lose you again. I know you won't, it's just that I'm unorganized and I want to find you when something good happens. If you come down, we'll go to town - I haven't been there for years. But I'd be fine wasting our time not doing anything here.",
    "When the moon is in the Seventh House, and Jupiter aligns with Mars. Then peace will guide the planets, and love will steer the stars. This is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius, Age of Aquarius. Aquarius! Aquarius!",
    "You been confusing since the day I met you. Another night chasing, this feels like home. Since I've been miles away, no change. Outsider inside looking dazed. Just wash the glitter off your face and go home.",
    "All this running around. I can't fight it much longer. Something's trying to get out. And it's never been closer. If my ticker fails, make up some other story. But if I never come back, tell my mother I'm sorry.",

    "Kinda cold, walking home. Growing older on my own. Feels so strange to say when I am not alone. Faith will claim to be a friend to those she own but she will never try to call when I'm by the phone.",
    "What drives me out of the apartment to prowl through the city? I wander through the streets alone - not the relaxing stroll of a summer night, but the tense hurry to get - where?",

    "I heard some kids telling me, how they've lost faith in the way. They've been talking world peace, and the wars in the streets. The lines on their faces so deep. A revolution or reach out and touch the day. We're overdue child.",
    "But words are not dolls: who cares about antidisestablishmentarianism from the point of view of real language, or floccinaucinihilipilification? (\"the action or habit of estimating as worthless\" - at one time the longest word in the OED) or mallemaroking (look it up)?",

    "In our analysis of constant-current source circuits, we have assumed a piecewise linear approximation for the B-E voltage, Vbe(on).

    "But of bliss and glad life there is little to be said, before it ends; as works fair and wonderful, while they still endure for eyes to see, are ever their own record, and only when they are in peril and broken for ever do they pass into song.",
    "Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them. And some are given a chance to climb; they cling to the realm or the gods or love. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.",
    "In a way fighting was just like using magic. You said the words, and they altered the universe. By merely speaking you could create damage and pain, cause tears to fall, drive people away, make yourself feel better, make your life worse.",
    "A magician is strong because he feels pain. He feels the difference between what the world is and what he would make of it. Or what did you think that stuff in your chest was? A magician is strong because he hurts more than others. His wound is his strength.",
    "Concealing the origins of money obtained illegally by passing it through a complex sequence of banking transfers or commercial transactions is a crime.",
    "There is a door at the end of a silent corridor. And it's haunting Harry Potter's dreams. Why else would he be waking in the middle of the night, screaming in terror?",
    "Middle management means that you got just enough responsibility to listen when people talk, but not so much you can't tell anybody to go screw themselves.",
    "If anybody asks you if you in this game, you tell 'em you in it for life, a'ight? You play it hard, you play it tight, and you make sure they know you gonna stand by your people. No loose talk, no second thoughts and no snitching. Play it like that.",
    "The past is always with us. Where we come from, what we go through, how we go through it; all this matters. Like at the end of the book, ya know, boats and tides and all. It's like you can change up, right, you can say you're somebody new, you can give yourself a whole new story.",
    "Now you make sure you tell old Marlo I burned the money. 'Cause it ain't about that paper. It's about me hurtin' his people and messin' with his world. Tell that boy he ain't man enough to come down to the street with Omar. You tell him that!",
    "You are amoral, are you not? You are feeding off the violence and the despair of the drug trade. You're stealing from those who themselves are stealing the lifeblood from our city.",
    "Tony Soprano: All due respect to New York, I don't think you should be tellin' my uncle how to run things. Johnny Sack: You think I got the balls to drive in from New York and tell your uncle how he should run his family? I shouldn't expect to see the Statue of Liberty again if I did that, huh?",
    "How about tellers? You take tellers. They never tell you anything. They always ask questions. And interest, there's nothing interesting about it at all. It's boring. Oh and then the trust department, they got all the pens chained down to the tables. What kind of trust is that?",
    "Italian imports - sixty-five smackeroonies. That's right, notice the, uh, sleek European styling there, the sturdy reinforced frames and the high tech shatterproof reflective lenses that allow me to scope out the dollies without, uh, drawing attention to myself.",
    "Don't you see? What these two people, who are such geniuses at romance, are trying to do is to get you to take your hair down, thinking that it will stimulate me like some sort of Pavlovian dog. So, why don't you just oblige them. Get this silliness over with so we can get on with our lives.",

    "I have a small favor to ask regarding our impending wedding. Since all of my close friends will be out of town and we have had a previous conversation and our eyes have met on a number of occasions I was wondering if you'd consent to be my maid of honor.",
    "To recap; sitting in the bar today we have among others a man who is actually simple enough to hypnotize himself. I'd like to offer the suggestion that we've seen it all. [Sam enters wearing a military uniform] Happily I stand corrected.",
    "Well you know she hates to travel. Besides we decided this was a perfect opportunity to test my theories about marital fidelity. And I'm glad to say that after 10 months of celibacy, I can now pronounce my principles sound.",
    "It's an incredible sensation. You have to be very quiet. Take it down with the first shot or you scare it away. Then sometimes you have to go up and finish it off. Then you tie it to the bumper and go home.",
    "Okay, go ahead. Call her, get married, have babies, have a great life... What do I care? I'm finished. It's all over for me. In fact, let's end it right now. Jerry, kill me, kill me now. I'm begging you. Let's just get it over with. Be a pal... Just take the pillow and put it over my face.",
    "I can't perform under pressure. That's why I never play anything for money, I choke. I could choke tonight. And she works in my office, can you imagine? She goes around telling everyone what happened? Maybe I should cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this.",

    "George: I can't return the book. It's been flagged in every Brentano's in town. So instead I'm going to steal it, return it, get my money back, and then everything will be even. Jerry: You defile one book, steal another, get your money back, and that seems even to you?",
    "Often, after the first years of marriage, the husband seems to lose interest in the wife. He reads the paper at the breakfast table, he doesn't answer when you talk to him. In short, he doesn't even know you're alive.",
    "Well, now, wait a minute, Ethel, look. You get yourself a little black, off-the-shoulder blouse, and a big cushy belt, and little ballet slippers, and you're all set!",
    "Fred: What about ten dollars? Ethel: What's the matter with twenty dollars? Ricky: Well what's the matter with thirty dollars? Lucy: Well what's the matter with fifty dollars? Fred: What was the matter with ten dollars?",
    "But I will tell you this. I'd use tonight to get myself organized. Ride out in the morning clear-headed. And startin' tomorrow morning, I will offer a personal $50 bounty for every decapitated head of as many of these godless heathens as anyone can bring in.",
    "I don't believe you commissioned me to make an offer on the widow's claim to keep the regulators off you, Al. I think someone found something out there you want.",

    "Well, you told me I have a plethora. And I just would like to know if you know what a plethora is. I would not like to think that a person would tell someone he has a plethora, and then find out that that person has no idea what it means to have a plethora.",
    "Some say better things will come our way. No matter what they try to say, you were always there for me. Some way, when the sun begins to shine, I hear a song from another time and fade away.",
    "I close my eyes only for a moment, and the moment's gone. All my dreams pass before my eyes, a curiosity. Dust in the wind, all they are is dust in the wind.",
    "As to my own part, having turned my thoughts for many years upon this important subject, and maturely weighed the several schemes of other projectors, I have always found them grossly mistaken in their computation.",
    "It doesn't matter what I say, so long as I sing with inflection that makes you feel I'll convey some inner truth or vast reflection. But I've said nothing so far, and I can keep it up for as long as it takes.",
    "If you're feeling fancy free, come wander through the world with me, and any place we chance to be will be a rendezvous. Two for the road, we'll travel through the years collecting precious memories, selecting souvenirs and living life the way we please.",
    "Blue skies smiling at me. Nothing but blue skies do I see. Bluebirds singing a song. Nothing but bluebirds all day long. Blue days, all of them gone. Nothing but blue skies from now on.",
    "Often I think this sad old world is whistling in the dark, just like a child who, late from school, walks bravely home through the park. To keep their spirits soaring and keep the night at bay, neither quite knowing which way they are going, they sing the shadows away.",
    "I do not see it. It is interesting that people try to find meaningful patterns in things that are essentially random. I have noticed that the images they perceive sometimes suggest what they are thinking about at that particular moment. Besides, it is clearly a bunny rabbit.",
    "All right, but apart from the sanitation, medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh water system and public health, what have the Romans ever done for us?",

    "And men go abroad to admire the heights of mountains, the mighty billows of the sea, the broad tides of rivers, the compass of the ocean, and the circuits of the stars, and pass themselves by.",
    "In my own case, I have several times happened to overlook results which ought to have struck me blind, as being immediate consequences of other ones which I had obtained. Most of these proceed from the cause which we have just mentioned, viz., from attention too narrowly directed.",
    "Very often research which has deeply interested me while I was investigating it loses its interest for me just after I have the solution, unhappily at a time which coincides with the period when I have to record it. After a while, say a couple of months, I come to a more just appreciation of it.",
    "Here he was writing a formula the accuracy of which was certain, but whose origin in his brain and way of discovery he did not explain and we could not guess.",

    "Whereas by the benefit of words and ratiocination they exceed brute beasts in knowledge, and the commodities that accompany the same, so they exceed them also in error.",
    "Look round at the courses of the stars, as if thou wert going along with them; and constantly consider the changes of the elements into one another; for such thoughts purge away the filth of the terrene life.",
    "We used to look at the stars and confess our dreams, hold each other till the morning light. We used to laugh, now we only fight. Baby, are you lonesome now?",
    "I hate this place, this zoo, this prison, this reality, whatever you want to call it. I can't stand it any longer. It's the smell, if there is such a thing. I feel saturated by it. I can taste your stink, and every time I do, I fear that I've somehow been infected by it.",
    "Down at the roller rink, all the cool kids crowding around the air hockey table. \"Hey, my best friend likes you,\" I hear you shout at me as you go skating by.",
    "Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go. So make the best of this test, and don't ask why; it's not a question, but a lesson learned in time. It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life.",
    "My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me, so won't you kill me, so I die happy? My heart is yours to fill or burst, to break or bury or wear as jewelry, whichever you prefer.",
    "Come with me and you'll be in a world of pure imagination. Take a look and you'll see into your imagination. We'll begin with a spin, traveling in the world of my creation. What we'll see will defy explanation.",
    "Is there a cure among us from this processed sanity? I weaken with each voice that sings. Now in this world of purchase, I'm going to buy back memories to awaken some old quality.",
    "The seaweed is always greener in somebody else's lake. You dream about going up there, but that is a big mistake. Just look at the world around you right here on the ocean floor. Such wonderful things surround you. What more is you looking for?",
    "I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream. I know you, the gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam. Yet I know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem, but if I know you, I know what you'll do - you'll love me at once, the way you did once upon a dream.",

    "I want adventure in the great wide somewhere. I want it more than I can tell. And for once it might be grand to have someone understand; I want so much more than they've got planned.",
    "To be my own master. Such a thing would be greater than all the magic and all the treasures in all the world! But what am I talking about? Let's get real here, it's not gonna happen. Genie, wake up and smell the hummus.",
    "Charge 'em for the lice, extra for the mice, two percent for looking in the mirror twice. Here a little slice, there a little cut, three percent for sleeping with the window shut. When it comes to fixing prices, there are a lot of tricks he knows.",

    "Stars, in your multitudes - scarce to be counted, filling the darkness with order and light. You are the sentinels, silent and sure, keeping watch in the night. You know your place in the sky, you hold your course and your aim, and each in your season returns and returns and is always the same.",
    "I dreamed a dream in time gone by, when hope was high and life worth living. I dreamed that love would never die. I dreamed that God would be forgiving. Then I was young and unafraid when dreams were made and used and wasted. There was no ransom to be paid, no song unsung, no wine untasted.",
    "I'll keep searching deep within my soul for all the answers. Don't wanna hurt no more. I need peace, gotta feel at ease. Need to be free from pain, going insane. My heart aches, yeah.",
    "Listen carefully, my friend. You are stuck in a paradox. It turns out there are three things you cannot do in virtual reality. You cannot die, you cannot get grounded, and you cannot call customer service. This is why you are having problems.",
    "As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid.",

    "Most of what I learnt at Cambridge had to be painfully unlearnt later; on the whole, what I had learnt for myself from being left alone in an old library had proved more solid.",
    "For all my brave talk, I knew it was just that. No matter how much I trained or how much I studied, the best test score in the world wasn't gonna matter unless I had the blood test to go with it.",
    "Hey you, out there in the cold, getting lonely, getting old, can you feel me? Hey you, standing in the aisles with itchy feet and fading smiles, can you feel me? Hey you, don't help them to bury the light. Don't give in without a fight.",
    "Looking back, I saw that for my whole conscious life I had not understood either myself or my strivings. What had seemed for so long to be beneficial now turned out in actuality to be fatal, and I had been striving to go in the opposite direction to that which was truly necessary to me.",
    "You know, when I was a kid, food was food. Before our scientific magicians poisoned the water, polluted the soil, decimated plant and animal life. Why, in my day, you could buy meat anywhere. Eggs, they had. Real butter, fresh lettuce in the stores.",
    "For 360 minutes per diem, we receive unconscious reinforcement of the deep thesis that the most significant feature of truly alive persons is watchableness, and that genuine human worth is not just identical with but rooted in the phenomenon of watching.",

    "For the soul there is a satisfaction of a higher type; the material is not at all necessary. Whether I apply mathematics to a couple of clods of dirt, which we call planets, or to purely arithmetical problems, it's just the same; the latter have only a higher charm for me.",

    "It's getting harder and harder for me to return to my true form. Some nights, I can't do it at all. What's causing it? Iron roads and machines that breathe smoke. Magic is draining from the world, and with it, we magical creatures grow ever weaker.",

    "Through meticulous analysis of history, I will find a way to make the people worship me. By studying the conquerors of days gone by, I'll discover the mistakes that made them go awry.",
    "See, I write jokes for a living, man. You know, I sit in my hotel at night, I think of something that's funny, then I go get a pen and I write it down. Or, if the pen's too far away, I have to convince myself that what I thought of ain't funny.",
    "But rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others. I do not add \"within the limits of the law\" because law is often but the tyrant's will, and always so when it violates the rights of the individual.",

    "Power don't come from a badge or a gun. Power comes from lying. Lying big, and gettin' the whole damn world to play along with you. Once you got everybody agreeing with what they know in their hearts ain't true, you've got 'em by the balls.",

    "You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. There's more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!",
    "It's a universal translator. We're not even supposed to have it, and I'll tell you why: human thought is so primitive, it's looked upon as an infectious disease in some of the better galaxies. That kind of makes you proud, doesn't it?",
    "So they put on their friendly faces to pass their beloved VRA, but make no mistake, mine is the true face of vampire! Why would we seek equal rights? You are not our equals.",
    "Punch me in the face. - Punch you? - Yes, punch me in the face. Didn't you hear me? - I always hear \"punch me in the face\" when you're speaking, but it's usually subtext.",

    "Now that you're out of high school, which means you're technically an adult, don't you think it's time you move on from primitive constructs such as popularity?",

    "An ochre love in the heart of all, an ochre love and the cold sea shores, dear. My blood is yours for the night, 'cause my fears are only little things like these cold seas and broken strings.",
    "There was a time when I was alone, nowhere to go and no place to call home. My only friend was the man in the moon and even sometimes he would go away, too. Then one night, as I closed my eyes, I saw a shadow flying high. He came to me with the sweetest smile, told me he wanted to talk for a while.",
    "I remember how you said that sometimes it gets just a little hard being home. There's sand stuck in my bed and memories in my head, love, I've been trying to let this whole thing go.",
    "Half the world was pulling on his colors, as nights turned into days to the hours. A glow was coming down, coming down. I don't know why, but it felt like a tiger striped sky.",
    "It takes the average human seven minutes to go to sleep, but according to Hand's Human Physiology, it takes the same average human fifteen to twenty minutes to wake up. It is as if sleep is a pool from which emerging is more difficult than entering.",
    "Oh? You're approaching me? Instead of running away, you come right to me? Even though your grandfather, Joseph, told you the secret of The World, like an exam student scrambling to finish the problems on an exam until the last moments before the chime?",
    "I've never been invincible in a fight. I've lost loads of times. But I'll definitely crawl through the mud and stand up again. And then I'll finish this! In a man's fight, you don't lose until you accept defeat, no matter how much you get beat up!",
    "Earth, like most planets, has strong temperature gradients, as illustrated by the accumulation of ice at the poles. Modifying this latitudinal temperature gradient are other factors such as winds, mountains and large water bodies. All of these factors also influence precipitation patterns.",
    "Failure is... Listen up! True failure is forgetting the pioneer spirit and staying far away from challenging hardships! There is no such thing as failure in this race! There are only adventurers! This Steel Ball Run race will be an event the likes of which the world has never experienced before!",
    "I know it's a mistake. But there are certain things in life where you know it's a mistake, but you don't really know it's a mistake, because the only way to really know it's a mistake is to make the mistake.",
    "The bird, the pin, the song, the berries, the watch, the cracker, the dress that burst into flames. I am the mockingjay. The one that survived despite the Capitol's plans. The symbol of the rebellion.",
    "Whatever happened to the values of humanity? Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity, lack of understanding leading us away from unity. That's the reason why sometimes I'm feeling under, that's the reason why sometimes I'm feeling down.",
    "The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far.",
    "Days can be sunny, with never a sigh, don't need what money can buy. Birds in the trees sing their day full of song, why shouldn't we sing along? I'm chipper all the day, happy with my lot. How do I get that way? Look at what I've got.",
    "Even if you lose a spell card battle, you win if you feel good. It's a game after all. A game isn't there to entertain you. You enjoy the game yourself. Maybe when you reach the point when you can enjoy anything, you see the true glamour of the spell card for the first time.",
    "Going to bed hungry. Scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I was the one who stopped that. You know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise.",
    "I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right, yet to fail nonetheless. Dread it. Run from it. Destiny still arrives. Or should I say, I have.",
    "We're a couple of swells, we stop at the best hotels, but we prefer the country far away from the city smells. We're a couple of sports, the pride of the tennis courts; in June, July and August we look cute when we're dressed in shorts.",
    "We would ride up the avenue, but we haven't got the price. We would skate up the avenue, but there isn't any ice. We would ride on a bicycle, but we haven't got a bike. So we'll walk up the avenue, yes, we'll walk up the avenue, and to walk up the avenue's what we like.",
    "Way down upon the Swanee River, far, far away, there's where my heart is turning ever, there's where the old folks stay. All up and down the whole creation, sadly I roam. Still longing for the old plantation, and for the old folks at home.",
    "Beautiful dreamer, wake unto me, starlight and dewdrops are waiting for thee. Sounds of the rude world heard in the day, lulled by the moonlight have all passed away. Beautiful dreamer, queen of my song, listen while I woo thee with soft melody.",
    "Whenever there is a meeting, a parting shall follow. But that parting needs not last forever. Whether a parting be forever or merely for a short while... that is up to you.",
    "Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank just outside of Rubicon.",
    "A young man stands in his bedroom. It just so happens that today, the 13th of April, 2009, is this young man's birthday. Though it was thirteen years ago he was given life, it is only today he will be given a name! What will the name of this young man be?",
    "I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to. When I'm lying close to someone else. You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it. If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you.",
    "So it was that over the course of time, the man and the weapon seemed as one. Ashbringer became a name of legend, attributed not just to the fearsome blade but also to the relentless knight who wielded it.",
    "I am the hope of the universe. I am the answer to all living things that cry out for peace. I am protector of the innocent. I am the light in the darkness. I am truth. Ally to good! Nightmare to you!",
    "I don't like you, but I love you. Seems that I'm always thinking of you. Oh, you treat me badly, I love you madly, you really got a hold on me. I don't want you, but I need you. Don't want to kiss you, but I need to. Oh, you do me wrong now, my love is strong now, you really got a hold on me.",
    "One day, the guy on a buffalo was cruisin' around through the plains. Seen a bear; and he thought to himself, \"Oh man! I gotta get away from the bear. Hope he don't chase... Oh no! He's gonna chase me. Oh no! I better turn around and chase him back 'cause guess what! I'm on a buffalo!\"",
    "Be careful, you are not in Wonderland. I've heard the strange madness long growing in your soul. But you are fortunate in your ignorance, in your isolation. You who have suffered, find where love hides. Give, share, lose - lest we die, unbloomed.",

    "He is here, actually he was here! He's just nipped out to go to the toilet a few minutes ago. His drink is over there on the table by those barrels. The only problem is that no one has ever actually seen a toilet in RuneScape so he may take a little while.",
    "Empty spaces, what are we living for? Abandoned places, I guess we know the score. On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for? Another hero, another mindless crime: behind the curtain, in the pantomime. Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore? The show must go on.",
    "These rappers don't know what to do, cause all I did was act me like a Loony Tune. I'll give you all of me until there's nothing left, I swear this summer will be summer camp.",
    "You don't need money, don't take fame. Don't need no credit card to ride this train. It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes, but it might just save your life. That's the power of love.",
    "It's true! Yes, I have been ill, very ill. But why do you say that I have lost control of my mind, why do you say that I am mad? Can you not see that I have full control of my mind? Indeed, the illness only made my mind, my feelings, my senses stronger, more powerful.",
    "Well, I'm not Superman, that's for sure. And I'm not Batman, or Spiderman, or Aquaman, or a merman, or a wolfman. I'm not a brahman, or common, or ramen. I'm not a caiman either, so you don't really need to worry about anything. My name is Phi. I guess you could say... I am no man.",

    "How could you possibly see anything in here with that big hat over your eyes? I hate caves! Our kind isn't meant to be underground. We should be soaring high in the wide open sky.",
    "Hah, well, yeah, but I don't think you're gonna fit through this 'ere hole in the wall. We had to close up the passage recently to keep those crazed nematodes from comin' out and attackin' the village.",
    "Sorry, Dust - I don't think you're double jumping over that. Stupid avalanches ruin everything! Go ahead, name me one good thing an avalanche has ever done!",
    "I will not vanish, you will not scare me. Try to get through it, try to push through it. You were not thinking that I will not do it. They be lovin' someone and I'm another story. Take the next ticket, get the next train. Why would I do it? Anyone'd think that.",

    "When you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown. And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone. And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around. So have a good drown, as you go down, all alone... dragged down by the stone.",
    "Subatomic penetration, rapid fire through your skull. How I shot it on one taking it back to the days of trying to lose control. Swerving in a blaze of fire, raging through my bones.",
    "I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right, yet to fail nonetheless. It's frightening. Turns the legs to jelly. I ask you, to what end? Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same. And now, it's here. Or should I say, I am.",
    "Breathe, breathe in the air. Don't be afraid to care. Leave but don't leave me. Look around, choose your own ground. For long you live and high you fly. And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry. And all your touch and all you see is all your life will ever be.",
    "There before me was a woman who had finally, after all this time, made it to the start line, at the absolute worst moment imaginable. It was truly a tragic sight of a truly hopeless girl who had just begun her first love when it was far too late.",
    "Can't stop thinking about if and when I die. For now I see that \"if\" and \"when\" are truly different cries for, \"if\" is purely panic and \"when\" is solemn sorrow. And one invades today while the other spies tomorrow.",

    "It was a wicked, whimpering, winter plagued night. When my tongue grew wings, and took to flight. The thought had never crossed my mind before that moment. It's the truth so bent, it can't be broken.",
    "I'll find you in the morning sun and when the night is new. I'll be looking at the moon, but I'll be seeing you. I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day, in everything that's light and gay. I'll always think of you that way.",

    "You'll face lots of pain and despair on the way. In fact, the very road we walk is paved with tragedy. But we are the ones who chose to walk it. We'll take on the dirty work and bring about a new world. And once it's all over, we can disappear.",

    "You're asking how do I really feel, and I'm asking now how is this real. Oh, love is a plan that we can't control. All I can hope, that I'll fill the role. No one will ever know how I feel for you. Throw me a lifeline.",

    "Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless.",
    "And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'Do bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it.",
    "Somewhere in the forest where the waters meet lie the days before us. Spinning on repeat; there's darkness through the doorways. Silence in the streets, there's something in the stillness; a distant memory.",
    "This is a life-or-death elimination match. The only way to survive... is to win. There can be no doubt that those are the rules of the game. Which is why I am bowing out of the game.",
    "According to the Japanese cleaning consultant Marie Kondo: \"A dramatic reorganization of the home causes correspondingly dramatic changes in lifestyle and perspective. It is life transforming. I mean it.\"",
    "Who decides limits? And based on what? You said you worked hard? Well, maybe you need to work a little harder. Is that really the limit of your strength? Could you of tomorrow beat you today? Instead of giving in, move forward.",
    "There's an old saying my late grandma taught me. When you're ten, they call you a prodigy. When you're fifteen, they call you a genius. Once you hit twenty, you're just an ordinary person. About three years until I'm ordinary. Man... I can't wait to be ordinary.",
    "Nothing makes time pass or shortens the way like a thought that absorbs in itself all the faculties of the one who is thinking. External existence is then like a sleep of which this thought is the dream. Under its influence, time has no more measure, space has no more distance.",
    "In general, people only ask for advice that they may not follow it; or, if they should follow it, that they may have somebody to blame for having given it.",
    "Time, dear friend, time brings round opportunity; opportunity is the martingale of man. The more we have ventured the more we gain, when we know how to wait.",
    "Evil is Evil. Lesser, greater, middling... makes no difference. The degree is arbitrary. The definition's blurred. If I'm to choose between one evil and another... I'd rather not choose at all.",
    "Always! That is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it. Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to make it last for ever. It is a meaningless word, too. The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer.",
    "I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others.",
    "Just as I'm giving up, my heart is palpitating. Here's comes another one, it's so intoxicating. And being where I've been, I know that in the end I'll do it all again.",
    "Let the darkness lead us into the light, let our dreams get lost feel the temperature rise. Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie; one touch and I ignite. Like a starship speeding into the night. You and I get lost in the infinite lights. Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie; one touch and I ignite.",
    "And the game was over and the player woke up from the dream. And the player began a new dream. And the player dreamed again, dreamed better. And the player was the universe. And the player was love. You are the player. Wake up.",
    "All I do is talk a big game, and make myself sound like a big shot, when I can't do anything! I never do anything yet I complain like a pro. Who do you think I am? It's amazing that I can live like this and not feel ashamed!",
    "Listen, where I'm from there's a saying, \"Three heads are better than one.\" Wait, is it two heads? Whatever, the point is, three heads, thinking together are harder to break than only one arrow. It means you should rely on those around you instead of thinking about stuff alone!",
    "Tell me how we're not alike, but we work so well and we don't even know why. Funny how the stars crossed right, 'cause we work so well, and we don't even know why. You can call it fire and ice, but we work so well, and we don't even know why.",
    "Contrary to a popular impression, profits are achieved not by raising prices, but by introducing economies and efficiencies that cut costs of production.",
    "We live in a strange and wonderful universe. Its age, size, violence, and beauty require extraordinary imagination to appreciate. The place we humans hold within this vast cosmos can seem pretty insignificant. And so we try to make sense of it all and to see how we fit in.",
    "You're missing the point. There's no throne, there is no version of this where you come out on top. Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you. Because if we can't protect the Earth, you can be damned well sure we'll avenge it.",
    "I am Heavy Weapons Guy and this is my weapon. She weighs 150 kilograms and fires $200, custom-tool cartridges at 10,000 rounds per minute. It costs $400,000 to fire this weapon for 12 seconds.",
    "I really don't think you have anything to worry about, Charlie Brown. After all, science has shown that a person's character isn't really established until he's at least five years old.",
    "After snow comes up, the wind blows it around so it looks like it's coming down but actually it comes up out of the ground - like grass. It comes up, Charlie Brown, snow comes up!",
    "Preposterous! To think that a human being could be destroyed by an animal ten thousand times smaller than a flea. It's as though an army of ants were to overthrow your Majesty's empire.",
    "The night is bitter, the stars have lost their glitter, the winds grow colder, suddenly you're older, and all because of the man that got away. No more his eager call, the writings on the wall, the dreams you've dreamed have all gone astray.",
    "Grab your coat and get your hat, leave your worry on the doorstep. Just direct your feet to the sunny side of the street. Can't you hear a pitter-pat? And that happy tune is your step. Life can be so sweet on the sunny side of the street.",
    "It is so discouraging not to have any advice and companionship about my work. When I get really well, John says we will ask Cousin Henry and Julia down for a long visit; but he says he would as soon put fireworks in my pillow-case as to let me have those stimulating people about now.",
    "When I'm stressed, I recite the four species of Antarctic penguin. Adelie, Chinstrap, Emperor and Gentoo. It helps. Mom taught me when I was little. You should try it next time you think you're dying. Except if you really are dying, it won't help at all.",
    "Still, there are times I am bewildered by each mile I have traveled, each meal I have eaten, each person I have known, each room in which I have slept. As ordinary as it all appears, there are times when it is beyond my imagination.",
    "You don't listen, do you? You just ask the same questions every week. \"How's your job?\" \"Are you having any negative thoughts?\" All I have are negative thoughts.",
    "In this particular instance it is not at all far-fetched to think of it as a piercing ray of light, penetrating the chromatic coils and darkness of the storm and magically initiating the process of dispersal.",
    "Clouds begin to tear; sky is bleeding hair. God is weeping tears; you are full of fears. Vehement lightning quake; head begins to ache. Lord has thunder snake; Balrog he will break. And thus, revenge was fruitless, for one who had been turned, and we are reminded who lords over this altered world.",
    "Impertinent and ignorant, deathless and restless. Cold contrite cowards. Digitised satellite, augmented entities. Unremembered God. The world fades to black; digital black. Welcome to an altered future.",
    "So I built a machine; a human machine. I made it with steel and soy-protein. Born from a test tube and into a vat. To live and to heave and to die just like that.",
    "I can't believe you were dumb enough to entrust your hard-earned cabbage to a corrupt government-backed bank. FDIC? More like, FDI-see you later, money.",
    "If you lie and pretend that you like them, you're fine. But if you tell them the truth, you get fired, you can't afford food, and you get shanked for cutting in line at the soup kitchen. And then you die.",
    "If there's one thing I learned from Rodrick, it's to set people's expectations real low so you end up surprising them by practically doing nothing at all.",
    "There was one time when we were children. He transformed himself into a snake, and he knows that I love snakes. So I went to pick up the snake to admire it, and he transformed back into himself and he was like, \"Blech, it's me!\" And he stabbed me. We were eight at the time.",
    "He's got to make his own mistakes and learn to mend the mess he makes. He's old enough to know what's right but young enough not to choose it. He's noble enough to win the world but weak enough to lose it. He's a New World man...",
    "Whoever said that practice makes perfect is an idiot. Humans can't be perfect because we are not machines. The best thing that you can say about practice is that it makes better.",
    "I am Dracula and I welcome you to my house. I must apologize for not being here to greet you personally, but I trust you've found everything you needed."
